"""
This file provides a set of context managers and utility functions for working with
Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver. These context managers help to assert the feasibility,
infeasibility, optimality, and objective value of CP-SAT models during testing.

It is especially intended to test for the trivial cases of your models, where you
can still can quickly get an off by one or wrong sign bugs. In some cases, these
may even remain unnoticed for a while.

Using these utils, you can super quickly write these trivial test cases and safe
yourself some time.
```python
def test_example():
    with expect_feasible() as model:
        # build model constraints
        x = model.new_bool_var("x")
        y = model.new_int_var(0, 10, "y")
        model.add(x + y == 1)
        # This will raise a RuntimeError if the model is infeasible.
```

Alternatively, you can use `assert_feasible()` and similar functions to check
the status of a model after solving it. These functions are useful for
asserting the status of a model without using context managers.
```python
def test_example():
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    x = model.new_bool_var("x")
    y = model.new_int_var(0, 10, "y")
    model.add(x + y == 1)
    # This will raise a RuntimeError if the model is infeasible.
    assert_feasible(model)
```

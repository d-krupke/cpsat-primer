# Using and Understanding OR-Tools' CP-SAT: A Primer and Cheat Sheet

![Cover Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_1.webp)

_By [Dominik Krupke](https://krupke.cc), TU Braunschweig_

Many [combinatorially difficult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)
optimization problems can, despite their proven theoretical hardness, be solved
reasonably well in practice. The most successful approach is to use
[Mixed Integer Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)
(MIP) to model the problem and then use a solver to find a solution. The most
successful solvers for MIPs are [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) and
[CPLEX](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/cplex-optimizer), which are both
commercial and expensive (though, free for academics). There are also some open
source solvers, but they are often not as powerful as the commercial ones.
However, even when investing in such a solver, the underlying techniques
([Branch and Bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound) &
[Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_cut) on
[Linear Relaxations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming_relaxation))
struggle with some optimization problems, especially if the problem contains a
lot of logical constraints that a solution has to satisfy. In this case, the
[Constraint Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_programming)
(CP) approach may be more successful. For Constraint Programming, there are many
open source solvers, but they usually do not scale as well as MIP-solvers and
are worse in optimizing objective functions. While MIP-solvers are frequently
able to optimize problems with hundreds of thousands of variables and
constraints, the classical CP-solvers often struggle with problems with more
than a few thousand variables and constraints. However, the relatively new
[CP-SAT](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver) of Google's
[OR-Tools](https://github.com/google/or-tools/) suite shows to overcome many of
the weaknesses and provides a viable alternative to MIP-solvers, being
competitive for many problems and sometimes even superior.

This unofficial primer shall help you use and understand this powerful tool,
especially if you are coming from the
[Mixed Integer Linear Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming)
-community, as it may prove useful in cases where Branch and Bound performs
poorly.

If you are new to combinatorial optimization, I recommend starting with the free
course on Coursera,
[Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization)
taught by Pascal Van Hentenryck and Carleton Coffrin. This course provides a
comprehensive introduction in a concise format.

For an engaging exploration of a classic problem within this domain,
[In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman by Bill Cook](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691163529/in-pursuit-of-the-traveling-salesman)
is highly recommended. This book, along with this
[YouTube talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VjphFYQKj8) by the author that
lasts about an hour, offers a practical case study of the well-known Traveling
Salesman Problem. It not only introduces fundamental techniques but also delves
into the community and historical context of the field.

Additionally, the article
[Mathematical Programming](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/math-programming-modeling-basics/)
by CP-SAT's competitor Gurobi offers an insightful introduction to mathematical
programming and modeling. In this context, the term "Programming" does not refer
to coding; rather, it originates from an earlier usage of the word "program",
which denoted a plan of action or a schedule. If this distinction is new to you,
it is a strong indication that you would benefit from reading this article.

For those who prefer a hands-on approach, you can begin with the primer outlined
below and consult the recommended resources as needed.

Please note, while this primer strives to be self-contained, it is designed for
computer science students who already have a basic understanding of
combinatorial optimization as well as experience in coding with Python. Thus,
some prior knowledge in the field might be necessary to fully benefit from the
content provided. If you are a computer science student **without** prior
knowledge in combinatorial optimization, you may find
[this hands-on tutorial](https://pganalyze.com/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-constraint-programming-using-cp-sat)
a little easier to get started with CP-SAT, and come back once you want to dive
deeper.

## Installation

We are using Python 3 in this primer and assume that you have a working Python 3
installation as well as the basic knowledge to use it. There are also interfaces
for other languages, but Python 3 is, in my opinion, the most convenient one, as
the mathematical expressions in Python are very close to the mathematical
notation (allowing you to spot mathematical errors much faster). Only for huge
models, you may need to use a compiled language such as C++ due to performance
issues. For smaller models, you will not notice any performance difference.

The installation of CP-SAT, which is part of the OR-Tools package, is very easy
and can be done via Python's package manager
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```shell
pip3 install -U ortools
```

This command will also update an existing installation of OR-Tools. As this tool
is in active development, it is recommended to update it frequently. We actually
encountered wrong behavior, i.e., bugs, in earlier versions that then have been
fixed by updates (this was on some more advanced features, do not worry about
correctness with basic usage).

I personally like to use [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) for
experimenting with CP-SAT.

### What hardware do you need?

It is important to note that for CP-SAT usage, you do not need the capabilities
of a supercomputer. A standard laptop is often sufficient for solving many
problems. The primary requirements are CPU power and memory bandwidth, with a
GPU being unnecessary.

In terms of CPU power, the key is balancing the number of cores with the
performance of each individual core. CP-SAT leverages all available cores,
implementing different strategies on each.
[Depending on the number of cores, CP-SAT will behave differently](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/main/ortools/sat/docs/troubleshooting.md#improving-performance-with-multiple-workers).
However, the effectiveness of these strategies can vary, and it is usually not
apparent which one will be most effective. A higher single-core performance
means that your primary strategy will operate more swiftly. I recommend a
minimum of 4 cores and 16GB of RAM.

While CP-SAT is quite efficient in terms of memory usage, the amount of
available memory can still be a limiting factor in the size of problems you can
tackle. When it came to setting up our lab for extensive benchmarking at TU
Braunschweig, we faced a choice between desktop machines and more expensive
workstations or servers. We chose desktop machines equipped with AMD Ryzen 9
7900 CPUs (Intel would be equally suitable) and 96GB of DDR5 RAM, managed using
Slurm. This decision was driven by the fact that the performance gains from
higher-priced workstations or servers were relatively marginal compared to their
significantly higher costs. When on the road, I am often still able to do stuff
with my old Intel Macbook Pro from 2018 with an i7 and only 16GB of RAM, but
large models will overwhelm it. My workstation at home with AMD Ryzen 7 5700X
and 32GB of RAM on the other hand rarely has any problems with the models I am
working on.

For further guidance, consider the
[hardware recommendations for the Gurobi solver](https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/8172407217041-What-hardware-should-I-select-when-running-Gurobi-),
which are likely to be similar. Since we frequently use Gurobi in addition to
CP-SAT, our hardware choices were also influenced by their recommendations.

## Example

![Example Cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_example.webp)

Before we dive into any internals, let us take a quick look at a simple
application of CP-SAT. This example is so simple that you could solve it by
hand, but know that CP-SAT would (probably) be fine with you adding a thousand
(maybe even ten- or hundred-thousand) variables and constraints more. The basic
idea of using CP-SAT is, analogous to MIPs, to define an optimization problem in
terms of variables, constraints, and objective function, and then let the solver
find a solution for it. We call such a formulation that can be understood by the
corresponding solver a _model_ for the problem. For people not familiar with
this
[declarative approach](https://programiz.pro/resources/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/),
you can compare it to SQL, where you also just state what data you want, not how
to get it. However, it is not purely declarative, because it can still make a
huge(!) difference how you model the problem and getting that right takes some
experience and understanding of the internals. You can still get lucky for
smaller problems (let us say a few hundred to thousands of variables) and obtain
optimal solutions without having an idea of what is going on. The solvers can
handle more and more 'bad' problem models effectively with every year.

> **Definition:** A _model_ in mathematical programming refers to a mathematical
> description of a problem, consisting of variables, constraints, and optionally
> an objective function that can be understood by the corresponding solver
> class. _Modelling_ refers to transforming a problem (instance) into the
> corresponding framework, e.g., by making all constraints linear as required
> for Mixed Integer Linear Programming. Be aware that the
> [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT_solver)-community uses the term
> _model_ to refer to a (feasible) variable assignment, i.e., solution of a
> SAT-formula. If you struggle with this terminology, maybe you want to read
> this short guide on
> [Math Programming Modelling Basics](https://www.gurobi.com/resources/math-programming-modeling-basics/).

Our first problem has no deeper meaning, except of showing the basic workflow of
creating the variables (x and y), adding the constraint $x+y<=30$ on them,
setting the objective function (maximize $30*x + 50*y$), and obtaining a
solution:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Variables
x = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "y")

# Constraints
model.add(x + y <= 30)

# Objective
model.maximize(30 * x + 50 * y)

# Solve
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.solve(model)

# The status tells us if we were able to compute an optimal solution.
assert status == cp_model.OPTIMAL, "Could not find optimal solution."

# Print the optimal solution.
print(f"x={solver.value(x)},  y={solver.value(y)}")
```

    x=0,  y=30

Pretty easy, right? For solving a generic problem, not just one specific
instance, you would of course create a dictionary or list of variables and use
something like `model.add(sum(vars)<=n)`, because you do not want to create the
model by hand for larger instances.

> [!TIP]
>
> The solver can return five different statuses:
>
> | Status          | Code | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
> | --------------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
> | `UNKNOWN`       | 0    | The solver has not yet run.                                                                                                                                                           |
> | `MODEL_INVALID` | 1    | The model is invalid. You will rarely see that status.                                                                                                                                |
> | `FEASIBLE`      | 2    | The model has a feasible, but not necessarily optimal, solution. If your model does not have an objective, every feasible model will return `OPTIMAL`, which may be counterintuitive. |
> | `INFEASIBLE`    | 3    | The model has no feasible solution. This means that your constraints are too restrictive.                                                                                             |
> | `OPTIMAL`       | 4    | The model has an optimal solution. If your model does not have an objective, `OPTIMAL` is returned instead of `FEASIBLE`.                                                             |

For larger models, CP-SAT will unfortunately not always able to compute an
optimal solution. However, the good news is that the solver will likely still
find a satisfactory solution and provide a bound on the optimal solution. Once
you reach this point, understanding how to interpret the solver's log becomes
crucial for analyzing the solver's performance. We will learn more about this
later.

### Mathematical Model

The mathematical model of the code above would usually be written by experts
something like this:

```math
\max 30x + 50y
```

```math
\text{s.t. } x+y \leq 30
```

```math
\quad 0\leq x \leq 100
```

```math
\quad 0\leq y \leq 100
```

```math
x,y \in \mathbb{Z}
```

The `s.t.` stands for `subject to`, sometimes also read as `such that`.

### Overloading

One aspect of using CP-SAT solver that often poses challenges for learners is
understanding operator overloading in Python and the distinction between the two
types of variables involved. In this context, `x` and `y` serve as mathematical
variables. That is, they are placeholders that will only be assigned specific
values during the solving phase. To illustrate this more clearly, let us explore
an example within the Python shell:

```pycon
>>> model = cp_model.CpModel()
>>> x = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "x")
>>> x
x(0..100)
>>> type(x)
<class 'ortools.sat.python.cp_model.IntVar'>
>>> x + 1
sum(x(0..100), 1)
>>> x + 1 <= 1
<ortools.sat.python.cp_model.BoundedLinearExpression object at 0x7d8d5a765df0>
```

In this example, `x` is not a conventional number but a placeholder defined to
potentially assume any value between 0 and 100. When 1 is added to `x`, the
result is a new placeholder representing the sum of `x` and 1. Similarly,
comparing this sum to 1 produces another placeholder, which encapsulates the
comparison of the sum with 1. These placeholders do not hold concrete values at
this stage but are essential for defining constraints within the model.
Attempting operations like `if x + 1 <= 1: print("True")` will trigger a
`NotImplementedError`, as the condition `x+1<=1` cannot be evaluated directly.

Although this approach to defining models might initially seem perplexing, it
facilitates a closer alignment with mathematical notation, which in turn can
make it easier to identify and correct errors in the modeling process.

### More examples

If you are not yet satisfied,
[this folder contains many Jupyter Notebooks with examples from the developers](https://github.com/google/or-tools/tree/stable/examples/notebook/sat).
For example

- [multiple_knapsack_sat.ipynb](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/examples/notebook/sat/multiple_knapsack_sat.ipynb)
  shows how to solve a multiple knapsack problem.
- [nurses_sat.ipynb](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/examples/notebook/sat/nurses_sat.ipynb)
  shows how to schedule the shifts of nurses.
- [bin_packing_sat.ipynb](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/examples/notebook/sat/bin_packing_sat.ipynb)
  shows how to solve a bin packing problem.
- ... (if you know more good examples I should mention here, please let me
  know!)

Further, you can find an extensive and beginner-friendly example on scheduling
workers
[here](https://pganalyze.com/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-constraint-programming-using-cp-sat).

Now that you have seen a minimal model, let us explore the various options
available for problem modeling. While an experienced optimizer might be able to
handle most problems using just the elements previously discussed, clearly
expressing your intentions can help CP-SAT optimize your problem more
effectively.

## Basic Modeling

![Cover Image Modelling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_2.webp)

In this chapter, we dive into the basic modeling capabilities of CP-SAT. CP-SAT
provides an extensive set of constraints, closer to high-level modeling
languages like MiniZinc than to traditional Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). For
example, it offers constraints like `all_different` and
`add_multiplication_equality`. These advanced features reduce the need for
modeling complex logic strictly through linear constraints, though they also
increase the interface's complexity. However, not all constraints are equally
efficient; linear and boolean constraints are generally most efficient, whereas
constraints like `add_multiplication_equality` can be significantly more
resource-intensive.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you are transitioning from Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), you might be
> used to manually implementing higher-level constraints and optimizing Big-M
> parameters for better performance. With CP-SAT, such manual adjustments are
> generally unnecessary. CP-SAT operates differently from typical MIP solvers by
> relying less on linear relaxation and more on its underlying SAT-solver and
> propagators to efficiently manage logical constraints. Embrace the
> higher-level constraints—they are often more efficient in CP-SAT.

This primer has been expanded to cover all constraints across two chapters,
complete with various examples to illustrate the contexts in which they can be
used. However, mastering modeling involves much more than just an understanding
of constraints. It requires a deep appreciation of the principles and techniques
that make models effective and applicable to real-world problems.

For a more detailed exploration of modeling, consider "Model Building in
Mathematical Programming" by H. Paul Williams, which offers extensive insight
into the subject, including practical applications. While this book is not
specific to CP-SAT, the foundational techniques and concepts are broadly
applicable. Additionally, for those new to this area or transitioning from MIP
solutions, studying Gurobi's modeling approach through this
[video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHiHZENG6W8CezJLx_cw9mNqpmviq3lO9)
might prove helpful. While many principles overlap, some strategies unique to
CP-SAT can better address cases where traditional MIP-solvers struggle.

### Variables

There are two important types of variables in CP-SAT: Booleans and Integers
(which are actually converted to Booleans, but more on this later). There are
also, e.g.,
[interval variables](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model#intervalvar),
but they are actually rather a combination of integral variables and discussed
[later](#04-modelling-intervals). For the integer variables, you have to specify
a lower and an upper bound.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
# integer variable z with bounds -100 <= z <= 100
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")  # new syntax
z_ = model.NewIntVar(-100, 100, "z_")  # old syntax
# boolean variable b
b = model.new_bool_var("b")  # new syntax
b_ = model.NewBoolVar("b_")  # old syntax
# implicitly available negation of b:
not_b = ~b  # will be 1 if b is 0 and 0 if b is 1
not_b_ = b.Not()  # old syntax
```

Additionally, you can use `model.new_int_var_series` and
`model.new_bool_var_series` to create multiple variables at once from a pandas
Index. This is especially useful if your data is given in a pandas DataFrame.
However, there is no performance benefit in using this method, it is just more
convenient.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
# create an Index from 0 to 9
index = pd.Index(range(10), name="index")
# create a pandas Series with 10 integer variables matching the index
xs = model.new_int_var_series("x", index, 0, 100)

# list of boolean variables
df = pd.DataFrame(
    data={"weight": [1 for _ in range(10)], "value": [3 for _ in range(10)]},
    index=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"],
)
bs = model.new_bool_var_series("b", df.index)  # noqa: F841
# Using the dot product on the pandas DataFrame is actually a pretty
# convenient way to create common linear expressions.
model.add(bs @ df["weight"] <= 100)
model.maximize(bs @ df["value"])
```

Additionally, there is the `new_constant`-method, which allows you to create a
variable that is constant. I have not found a use case for this yet, let me know
if you have one.

There are no continuous/floating point variables (or even constants) in CP-SAT:
If you need floating point numbers, you have to approximate them with integers
by some resolution. For example, you could simply multiply all values by 100 for
a step size of 0.01. A value of 2.35 would then be represented by 235. This
_could_ probably be implemented in CP-SAT directly, but doing it explicitly is
not difficult, and it has numerical implications that you should be aware of.

The absence of continuous variables may appear as a substantial limitation,
especially for those with a background in linear optimization where continuous
variables are typically regarded as the simpler component. However, if your
problem includes only a few continuous variables that must be approximated using
large integers and involves complex constraints such as absolute values, while
the majority of the problem is dominated by logical constraints, CP-SAT can
often outperform mixed-integer programming solvers. It is only when a problem
contains a substantial number of continuous variables and benefits significantly
from strong linear relaxation that mixed-integer programming solvers will have a
distinct advantage, despite CP-SAT having a propagator based on the dual simplex
method.

I analyzed the impact of resolution (i.e., the factor by which floating point
numbers are multiplied) on the runtime of CP-SAT, finding that the effect varied
depending on the problem. For one problem, the runtime increased only
logarithmically with the resolution, allowing the use of a very high resolution
of 100,000x without significant issues. In contrast, for another problem, the
runtime increased roughly linearly with the resolution, making high resolutions
impractical. The runtime for different factors in this case was: 1x: 0.02s, 10x:
0.7s, 100x: 7.6s, 1000x: 75s, and 10,000x: over 15 minutes, even though the
solution remained the same, merely scaled. Therefore, while high resolutions may
be feasible for some problems using CP-SAT, it is essential to verify their
influence on runtime, as the impact can be considerable.

In my experience, boolean variables are crucial in many combinatorial
optimization problems. For instance, the famous Traveling Salesman Problem
consists solely of boolean variables. Therefore, implementing a solver that
specializes in boolean variables using a SAT-solver as a foundation, such as
CP-SAT, is a sensible approach. CP-SAT leverages the strengths of SAT-solving
techniques, which are highly effective for problems dominated by boolean
variables.

You may wonder why it is necessary to explicitly name the variables in CP-SAT.
While there does not appear to be a technical reason for this requirement,
naming the variables can be extremely helpful for debugging purposes.
Understanding the naming scheme of the variables allows you to more easily
interpret the internal representation of the model, facilitating the
identification and resolution of issues. To be fair, there have only been a few
times when I actually needed to take a closer at the internal representation,
and in most of the cases I would have preferred not to have to name the
variables.

#### Domain Variables

When dealing with integer variables that you know will only need to take certain
values, or when you wish to limit their possible values, domain variables can
become interesting. Unlike regular integer variables, domain variables are
tailored to represent a specific set of values. This approach can enhance
efficiency when the domain - the range of sensible values - is small. However,
it may not be the best choice for larger domains.

CP-SAT works by converting all integer variables into boolean variables
(warning: simplification). For each potential value, it creates two boolean
variables: one indicating whether the integer variable is equal to this value,
and another indicating whether it is less than or equal to it. This is called an
_order encoding_. At first glance, this might suggest that using domain
variables is always preferable, as it appears to reduce the number of boolean
variables needed.

However, CP-SAT employs a lazy creation strategy for these boolean variables.
This means it only generates them as needed, based on the solver's
decision-making process. Therefore, an integer variable with a wide range - say,
from 0 to 100 - will not immediately result in 200 boolean variables. It might
lead to the creation of only a few, depending on the solver's requirements.

Limiting the domain of a variable can have drawbacks. Firstly, defining a domain
explicitly can be computationally costly and increase the model size drastically
as it now need to contain not just a lower and upper bound for a variable but an
explicit list of numbers (model size is often a limiting factor). Secondly, by
narrowing down the solution space, you might inadvertently make it more
challenging for the solver to find a viable solution. First, try to let CP-SAT
handle the domain of your variables itself and only intervene if you have a good
reason to do so.

If you choose to utilize domain variables for their benefits in specific
scenarios, here is how to define them:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()
# Define a domain with selected values
domain = cp_model.Domain.from_values([2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 90])
# cam also be done via intervals
domain_2 = cp_model.Domain.from_intervals([[8, 12], [14, 20]])

# there are also some operations available
domain_3 = domain.union_with(domain_2)

# Create a domain variable within this defined domain
x = model.new_int_var_from_domain(domain, "x")
```

This example illustrates the process of creating a domain variable `x` that can
only take on the values specified in `domain`. This method is particularly
useful when you are working with variables that only have a meaningful range of
possible values within your problem's context.

### Objectives

Not every problem necessitates an objective; sometimes, finding a feasible
solution is sufficient. CP-SAT excels at finding feasible solutions, a task at
which mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers often do not perform as well.
However, CP-SAT is also capable of effective optimization, which is an area
where older constraint programming solvers may lag, based on my experience.

CP-SAT allows for the minimization or maximization of a linear expression. You
can model more complex expressions by using auxiliary variables and additional
constraints. To specify an objective function, you can use the `model.minimize`
or `model.maximize` commands with a linear expression. This flexibility makes
CP-SAT a robust tool for a variety of optimization tasks.

```python
# Basic model with variables and constraints
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
model.add(x + 10 * y <= 100)

# Minimize 30x + 50y
model.maximize(30 * x + 50 * y)
```

Let us look on how to model more complicated expressions, using boolean
variables and generators.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x_vars = [model.new_bool_var(f"x{i}") for i in range(10)]
model.minimize(
    sum(i * x_vars[i] if i % 2 == 0 else i * x_vars[i].Not() for i in range(10))
)
```

This objective evaluates to

```math
\min \sum_{i=0}^{9} i\cdot x_i \text{ if } i \text{ is even else } i\cdot \neg x_i
```

To implement a
[lexicographic optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_optimization),
you can do multiple rounds and always fix the previous objective as constraint.

```python
# some basic model
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")
model.add(x + 10 * y - 2 * z <= 100)

# Define the objectives
first_objective = 30 * x + 50 * y
second_objective = 10 * x + 20 * y + 30 * z

# Optimize for the first objective
model.maximize(first_objective)
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
solver.solve(model)

# Fix the first objective and optimize for the second
model.add(first_objective == int(solver.objective_value))  # fix previous objective
model.minimize(second_objective)  # optimize for second objective
solver.solve(model)
```

To handle non-linear objectives in CP-SAT, you can employ auxiliary variables
and constraints. For instance, to incorporate the absolute value of a variable
into your objective, you first create a new variable representing this absolute
value. Shortly, you will learn more about setting up these types of constraints.
Below is a Python example demonstrating how to model and minimize the absolute
value of a variable `x`:

```python
# Assuming x is already defined in your model
abs_x = model.new_int_var(
    0, 100, "|x|"
)  # Create a variable to represent the absolute value of x
model.add_abs_equality(target=abs_x, expr=x)  # Define abs_x as the absolute value of x
model.minimize(abs_x)  # Set the objective to minimize abs_x
```

The constraints available to define your feasible solution space will be
discussed in the following section.

<a name="04-modelling-linear-constraints"></a>

### Linear Constraints

These are the classical constraints also used in linear optimization. Remember
that you are still not allowed to use floating point numbers within it. Same as
for linear optimization: You are not allowed to multiply a variable with
anything else than a constant and also not to apply any further mathematical
operations.

```python
model.add(10 * x + 15 * y <= 10)
model.add(x + z == 2 * y)

# This one actually is not linear but still works.
model.add(x + y != z)

# Because we are working on integers, the true smaller or greater constraints
# are trivial to implement as x < z is equivalent to x <= z-1
model.add(x < y + z)
model.add(y > 300 - 4 * z)
```

Note that `!=` can be expected slower than the other (`<=`, `>=`, `==`)
constraints, because it is not a linear constraint. If you have a set of
mutually `!=` variables, it is better to use `all_different` (see below) than to
use the explicit `!=` constraints.

Let us look at the following example with two linear equality constraints:

```math
x - y = 0
```

```math
4-y = 2y
```

```math
x, y \geq 0
```

You can verify that $x=4/3$ and $y=4/3$ is a feasible solution. However, coding
this in CP-SAT results in an infeasible solution:

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")

model.add(x - y == 0)
model.add(4 - x == 2 * y)

solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.solve(model)
assert status == cp_model.INFEASIBLE
```

Even using scaling techniques, such as multiplying integer variables by
1,000,000 to increase the resolution, would not render the model feasible. While
common linear programming solvers would handle this model without issue, CP-SAT
struggles unless modifications are made to eliminate fractions, such as
multiplying all terms by 3. However, this requires manual intervention, which
undermines the idea of using a solver. These limitations are important to
consider, although such scenarios are rare in practical applications.

If you have a lower and an upper bound for a linear expression, you can also use
the `add_linear_constraint`-method, which allows you to specify both bounds in
one go.

```python
model.add_linear_constraint(linear_expr=10 * x + 15 * y, lb=-100, ub=10)
```

The similar sounding `AddLinearExpressionInDomain` is discussed later.

<a name="04-modelling-logic-constraints"></a>

### Logical Constraints (Propositional Logic)

Propositional logic allows us to describe relationships between true or false
statements using logical operators. Consider a simple scenario where we define
three Boolean variables:

```python
b1 = model.new_bool_var("b1")
b2 = model.new_bool_var("b2")
b3 = model.new_bool_var("b3")
```

These variables, `b1`, `b2`, and `b3`, represent distinct propositions whose
truth values are to be determined by the model.

You can obtain the negation of a Boolean variable by using `~` or the
`.Not()`-method. The resulting variable can be used just like the original
variable:

```python
not_b1 = ~b1  # Negation of b1
not_b2 = b2.Not()  # Alternative notation for negation
```

Note that you can use more than three variables in all of the following
examples, except for `add_implication` which is only defined for two variables.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Boolean variables are essentially special integer variables restricted to the
> domain of 0 and 1. Therefore, you can incorporate them into linear constraints
> as well. However, it is important to note that integer variables, unlike
> Boolean variables, cannot be used in Boolean constraints. This is a
> distinction from some programming languages, like Python, where integers can
> sometimes substitute for Booleans.

#### Adding Logical OR Constraints

The logical OR operation ensures that at least one of the specified conditions
holds true. To model this, you can use:

```python
model.add_bool_or(b1, b2, b3)  # b1 or b2 or b3 must be true
model.add_at_least_one([b1, b2, b3])  # Alternative notation
model.add(b1 + b2 + b3 >= 1)  # Alternative linear notation using '+' for OR
```

Both lines ensure that at least one of `b1`, `b2`, or `b3` is true.

#### Adding Logical AND Constraints

The logical AND operation specifies that all conditions must be true
simultaneously. To model conditions where `b1` is true and both `b2` and `b3`
are false, you can use:

```python
model.add_bool_and(b1, b2.Not(), b3.Not())  # b1 and not b2 and not b3 must all be true
model.add_bool_and(b1, ~b2, ~b3)  # Alternative notation using '~' for negation
```

The `add_bool_and` method is most effective when used with the `only_enforce_if`
method. For cases not utilizing `only_enforce_if` a simple AND-clause such as
$\left( b_1 \land \neg b_2 \land \neg b_3 \right)$ becomes redundant by simply
substituting $b_1$ with `1` and $b_2`, $b_3` with `0`. In straightforward
scenarios, consider substituting these variables with their constant values to
reduce unnecessary complexity, especially in larger models where size and
manageability are concerns. In smaller or simpler models, CP-SAT efficiently
handles these redundancies, allowing you to focus on maintaining clarity and
readability in your model.

#### Adding Logical XOR Constraints

The logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation ensures that an odd number of operands
are true. It is crucial to understand this definition, as it has specific
implications when applied to more than two variables:

- For two variables, such as `b1 XOR b2`, the operation returns true if exactly
  one of these variables is true, which aligns with the "exactly one" constraint
  for this specific case.
- For three or more variables, such as in the expression `b1 XOR b2 XOR b3`, the
  operation returns true if an odd number of these variables are true. This
  includes scenarios where one or three variables are true, assuming the total
  number of variables involved is three.

This characteristic of XOR can be somewhat complex but is crucial for modeling
scenarios where the number of true conditions needs to be odd:

```python
model.add_bool_xor(b1, b2)  # Returns true if exactly one of b1 or b2 is true
model.add_bool_xor(
    b1, b2, b3
)  # Returns true if an odd number of b1, b2, b3 are true (i.e., one or three)
```

#### Specifying Unique Conditions

To enforce that exactly one or at most one of the variables is true, use:

```python
model.add_exactly_one([b1, b2, b3])  # Exactly one of the variables must be true
model.add_at_most_one([b1, b2, b3])  # No more than one of the variables should be true
```

These constraints are useful for scenarios where exclusive choices must be
modeled.

You could alternatively also use `add`.

```python
model.add(b1 + b2 + b3 == 1)  # Exactly one of the variables must be true
model.add(b1 + b2 + b3 <= 1)  # No more than one of the variables should be true
```

#### Modeling Implications

Logical implication, denoted as `->`, indicates that if the first condition is
true, the second must also be true. This can be modeled as:

```python
model.add_implication(b1, b2)  # If b1 is true, then b2 must also be true
```

You could also use `add`.

```python
model.add(b2 >= b1)  # If b1 is true, then b2 must also be true
```

<a name="04-modelling-conditional-constraints"></a>

### Conditional Constraints (Reification)

In practical applications, scenarios often arise where conditions dictate the
enforcement of certain constraints. For instance, "if this condition is true,
then a specific constraint should apply," or "if a constraint is violated, a
penalty variable is set to true, triggering another constraint." Additionally,
real-world constraints can sometimes be bypassed with financial or other types
of concessions, such as renting a more expensive truck to exceed a load limit,
or allowing a worker to take a day off after a double shift.

To effectively manage these conditional scenarios, CP-SAT offers the
`only_enforce_if`-method for linear and some Boolean constraints, which
activates a constraint only if a specified condition is met. This method is not
only typically more efficient than traditional methods like the
[Big-M method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_M_method) but also simplifies
the model by eliminating the need to determine an appropriate Big-M value.

```python
# A value representing the load that needs to be transported
load_value = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "load_value")

# ... some logic to determine the load value ...

# A variable to decide which truck to rent
truck_a = model.new_bool_var("truck_a")
truck_b = model.new_bool_var("truck_b")
truck_c = model.new_bool_var("truck_c")

# only rent one truck
model.add_at_most_one([truck_a, truck_b, truck_c])

# Depending on which truck is rented, the load value is limited
model.add(load_value <= 50).only_enforce_if(truck_a)
model.add(load_value <= 80).only_enforce_if(truck_b)
model.add(load_value <= 100).only_enforce_if(truck_c)

# Some additional logic
driver_has_big_truck_license = model.new_bool_var("driver_has_big_truck_license")
driver_has_special_license = model.new_bool_var("driver_has_special_license")
# Only drivers with a big truck license or a special license can rent truck c
model.add_bool_or(
    driver_has_big_truck_license, driver_has_special_license
).only_enforce_if(truck_c)

# Minimize the rent cost
model.minimize(30 * truck_a + 40 * truck_b + 80 * truck_c)
```

You can also use negations in the `only_enforce_if` method.

```python
model.add(x + y == 10).only_enforce_if(~b1)
```

You can also pass a list of Boolean variables to `only_enforce_if`, in which
case the constraint is only enforced if all of the variables in the list are
true.

```python
model.add(x + y == 10).only_enforce_if([b1, ~b2])  # only enforce if b1 AND NOT b2
```

### Absolute Values and Maximum/Minimum Functions with Integer Variables

When working with integer variables in CP-SAT, operations such as computing
absolute values, maximum, and minimum values cannot be directly expressed using
basic Python operations like `abs`, `max`, or `min`. Instead, these operations
must be handled through the use of auxiliary variables and specialized
constraints that map these variables to the desired values. The auxiliary
variables can then be used in other constraints, representing the desired
subexpression.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")

# Create an auxiliary variable for the absolute value of x+z
abs_xz = model.new_int_var(0, 200, "|x+z|")
model.add_abs_equality(target=abs_xz, expr=x + z)

# Create variables to capture the maximum and minimum of x, (y-1), and z
max_xyz = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "max(x, y, z-1)")
model.add_max_equality(target=max_xyz, exprs=[x, y - 1, z])

min_xyz = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "min(x, y, z)")
model.add_min_equality(target=min_xyz, exprs=[x, y - 1, z])
```

While some practitioners report that these methods are more efficient than those
available in classical Mixed Integer Programming solvers, such findings are
predominantly based on empirical evidence and specific use-case scenarios. It is
also worth noting that, surprisingly often, these constraints can be substituted
with more efficient linear constraints. Here is an example for achieving maximum
equality in a more efficient way:

```python
x = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "z")

# Ensure that max_xyz is at least the maximum of x, y, and z
max_xyz = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "max_xyz")
model.add(max_xyz >= x)
model.add(max_xyz >= y)
model.add(max_xyz >= z)

# Minimizing max_xyz to ensure it accurately reflects the maximum value
model.minimize(max_xyz)
```

This approach takes advantage of the solver's minimization function to tighten
the bound, accurately reflecting the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z`. By utilizing
linear constraints, this method can often achieve faster solving times compared
to using the `add_max_equality` constraint. Similar techniques also exist for
managing absolute and minimum values, as well as for complex scenarios where
direct enforcement of equality through the objective function is not feasible.

<a name="04-modelling-multdivmod"></a>

### Multiplication, Division, and Modulo

In practical problems, you may need to perform more complex arithmetic
operations than simple additions. Consider the scenario where the rental cost
for a set of trucks is calculated as the product of the number of trucks, the
number of days, and the daily rental rate. Here, the first two factors are
variables, leading to a quadratic expression. Attempting to multiply two
variables directly in CP-SAT will result in an error because the `add` method
only accepts linear expressions, which are sums of variables and constants.
However, CP-SAT supports multiplication, division, and modulo operations.
Similar to using `abs`, `max`, and `min`, you must create an auxiliary variable
to represent the result of the operation.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")

xyz = model.new_int_var(-(100**3), 100**3, "x*y*z")
model.add_multiplication_equality(xyz, [x, y, z])  # xyz = x*y*z

model.add_modulo_equality(x, y, 3)  # x = y % 3
model.add_division_equality(x, y, z)  # x = y // z
```

When using these operations, you often transition from linear to non-linear
optimization, which is generally more challenging to solve. In cases of
division, it is essential to remember that operations are on integers;
therefore, `5 // 2` results in `2`, not `2.5`.

Many problems initially involve non-linear expressions that can often be
reformulated or approximated using linear expressions. This transformation can
enhance the tractability and speed of solving the problem. Although modeling
your problem as closely as possible to the real-world scenario is crucial, it is
equally important to balance accuracy with tractability. A highly accurate model
is futile if the solver cannot optimize it efficiently. It might be beneficial
to employ multiple phases in your optimization process, starting with a simpler,
less accurate model and gradually refining it.

Some non-linear expressions can still be managed efficiently if they are convex.
For instance, second-order cone constraints can be solved in polynomial time
using interior point methods. Gurobi, for example, supports these constraints
natively. CP-SAT includes an LP-propagator but relies on the Dual Simplex
algorithm, which is not suitable for these constraints and must depend on
simpler methods. Similarly, most open-source MIP solvers may struggle with these
constraints.

It is challenging to determine if CP-SAT can handle non-linear expressions
efficiently or which solver would be best suited for your problem. Non-linear
expressions are invariably complex, and avoiding them when possible is
advisable.

Here is one of my students' favorite examples of a non-linear expression that
can be avoided. Once introduced to mathematical notation like
$\sum_{e\ in E} cost(e)\cdot x_e$, if a term depends on the combination of two
binary variables, they might initially opt for a quadratic expression such as
$\sum_{e,e'\in E} concost(e, e')\cdot x_e\cdot x_{e'}$. However, such cases can
often be modeled linearly using an auxiliary variable, avoiding the complexities
of non-linear modeling.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

b1 = model.new_bool_var("b1")
b2 = model.new_bool_var("b2")

b1b2 = model.new_bool_var("b1b2")
model.add_implication(~b1, ~b1b2)
model.add_implication(~b2, ~b1b2)
model.add_bool_or(~b1, ~b2, b1b2)  # optional, for a penalty term to be minimized.
```

There are numerous further instances where non-linear expressions can be
simplified by using auxiliary variables or by shifting the non-linear components
into constants. However, exploring these techniques is most beneficial when you
encounter specific challenges related to non-linear expressions in your models.

We will revisit further discussions on non-linear expressions and their
conversion to piecewise linear approximations in a subsequent section. This will
provide a foundational understanding necessary for addressing more complex
modeling scenarios effectively.

### `add_all_different` Constraint

In various assignment and scheduling problems, ensuring that all variables hold
distinct values is crucial. For example, in frequency assignment, no two
transmitters within the same area should operate on the same frequency, or in
scheduling, no two tasks should occupy the same time slot. Typically, this
requirement could be modeled with a quadratic number of inequality (`!=`)
constraints. However, a more elegant solution involves using the
`add_all_different` constraint, which directly enforces that all variables in a
list take unique values. This constraint is particularly useful in solving
puzzles like Sudoku or the
[N-queens problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/queens).

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")

# Adding an all-different constraint
model.add_all_different([x, y, z])

# Advanced usage with transformations
vars = [model.new_int_var(0, 10, f"v_{i}") for i in range(10)]
model.add_all_different([x + i for i, x in enumerate(vars)])
```

Using `add_all_different` not only simplifies the modeling but also utilizes a
dedicated domain-based propagator in CP-SAT, enhancing efficiency beyond what is
achievable with multiple `!=` constraints. However, if your model mixes `!=`
constraints with `add_all_different`, be cautious, as CP-SAT disables automatic
inference of `add_all_different` from groups of `!=` constraints, which can lead
to performance penalties.

For a practical demonstration, refer to the
[graph coloring problem example](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/examples/add_all_different.ipynb)
in our repository. Here, using `!=` constraints solved the problem in seconds,
whereas `add_all_different` took significantly longer, illustrating the
importance of choosing the right method based on the problem scale and
complexity.

Alternatively, modeling with Boolean variables and constraints like
`add_at_most_one` or pairwise negations (`add_boolean_or(~b1, ~b2)`) can also be
effective. This approach benefits from CP-SAT's efficient handling of Boolean
logic and allows for easy integration of additional constraints or objectives,
such as licensing costs associated with certain frequencies. Although CP-SAT
does something similar internally, it creates these constructs lazily and only
as needed, whereas explicit modeling in Python may not be as efficient.

The choice between these methods—or potentially another strategy—depends on
specific model requirements and familiarity with CP-SAT's behavior. When in
doubt, start with the most intuitive method and refine your approach based on
performance observations.

### Domains and Combinations

When optimizing scenarios with predefined feasible values or combinations of
variables—often outlined in a table—it is advantageous to directly restrict the
domain of an expression or set of variables.

Consider an example where you are optimizing a shift schedule for a team of
employees, and you have a table of feasible combinations for each shift:

| Employee 1 | Employee 2 | Employee 3 | Employee 4 |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1          | 0          | 1          | 0          |
| 0          | 1          | 1          | 0          |
| 1          | 0          | 0          | 1          |
| 0          | 1          | 0          | 1          |

In CP-SAT, this can be modeled efficiently using the `add_allowed_assignments`
method:

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x_employee_1 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_1")
x_employee_2 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_2")
x_employee_3 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_3")
x_employee_4 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_4")

# Define the allowed assignments
allowed_assignments = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1],
]

model.add_allowed_assignments(
    [x_employee_1, x_employee_2, x_employee_3, x_employee_4], allowed_assignments
)
```

Alternatively, forbidden combinations can be specified using
`add_forbidden_assignments`:

```python
prohibit_assignments = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1],
]
model.add_forbidden_assignments(
    [x_employee_1, x_employee_2, x_employee_3, x_employee_4], prohibit_assignments
)
```

The utility of the `add_allowed_assignments` method becomes more apparent when
integrated with other constraints within the model, rather than when it spans
all variables. If the table covered all variables, one could theoretically
evaluate each row to identify the best solution without the need for
sophisticated optimization techniques. However, consider this scenario where
constraints are integrated across multiple shifts:

```python
NUM_SHIFTS = 7

model = cp_model.CpModel()
x_employee_1 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_1_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]
x_employee_2 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_2_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]
x_employee_3 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_3_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]
x_employee_4 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_4_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]

for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS):
    model.add_allowed_assignments(
        [x_employee_1[i], x_employee_2[i], x_employee_3[i], x_employee_4[i]],
        allowed_assignments,
    )

# ... some further constraints and objectives to connect the days ...
# ... if the days would be independent, you would solve each day separately ...
```

The `add_allowed_assignments` method in CP-SAT enables the direct incorporation
of specific feasible combinations into your optimization model, ensuring that
only certain configurations of variables are considered within the solution
space. This method effectively "hard-codes" these configurations, simplifying
the model by predefining which combinations of variables are permissible, much
like setting rules for employee shifts or resource allocations.

A related method for managing linear expressions instead of direct assignments
is `add_linear_expression_in_domain`. Suppose we know a certain linear
expression, \(10x + 5y\), must equal 20, 50, or 100:

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")

domain = cp_model.Domain.from_values([20, 50, 100])
model.add_linear_expression_in_domain(10 * x + 5 * y, domain)
```

### Element/Array Constraints

Before exploring specialized constraints, let us examine the last of the generic
ones. The element constraint facilitates accessing the value of a variable
within an array using another variable as the index. Accessing a variable in an
array with a constant index is straightforward; however, integrating a variable
index into your model adds complexity. This constraint can also be use to ensure
that a variable matches the value at a specific array position.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")
var_array = [x, y, z]

# Create a variable for the index and a variable for the value at that index.
index_var = model.new_int_var(0, len(var_array) - 1, "index")
value_at_index_var = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "value_at_index")

# Apply the element constraint to link the index and value variables.
model.add_element(variables=var_array, index=index_var, target=value_at_index_var)
```

Examples of feasible variable assignments:

| `x` | `y` | `z` | `index_var` | `value_at_index` |
| --- | --- | --- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 0           | 3                |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 1           | 4                |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 2           | 5                |
| 7   | 3   | 4   | 0           | 7                |

The subsequent constraint resembles a stable matching in array form. For two
equally sized arrays of variables $v$ and $w$, each of size $|v|$, it imposes a
bijective relationship: $v[i]=j \Leftrightarrow w[j]=i$ for all
$i,j \in 0,\ldots,|v|-1$. This constraint limits the variables' values to
$0,\ldots, |v|-1$.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
v = [model.new_int_var(0, 5, f"v_{i}") for i in range(6)]
w = [model.new_int_var(0, 5, f"w_{i}") for i in range(6)]

model.add_inverse(v, w)
```

Examples of feasible variable assignments:

| array | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| w     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |

| array | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 0   |
| w     | 5   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

| array | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v     | 1   | 0   | 3   | 5   | 2   | 4   |
| w     | 1   | 0   | 4   | 2   | 5   | 3   |

### Circuit/Tour-Constraints

Routes and tours are essential in addressing optimization challenges across
various fields, far beyond traditional routing issues. For example, in DNA
sequencing, optimizing the sequence in which DNA fragments are assembled is
crucial, while in scientific research, methodically ordering the reconfiguration
of experiments can greatly reduce operational costs and downtime. The
`add_circuit` and `add_multiple_circuit` constraints in CP-SAT allow you to
easily model various scenarios. These constraints extend beyond the classical
[Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem),
allowing for solutions where not every node needs to be visited and
accommodating scenarios that require multiple disjoint sub-tours. This
adaptability makes them invaluable for a broad spectrum of practical problems
where the sequence and arrangement of operations critically impact efficiency
and outcomes.

| The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) asks for the shortest possible route that visits every vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. |

The Traveling Salesman Problem is one of the most famous and well-studied
combinatorial optimization problems. It is a classic example of a problem that
is easy to understand, common in practice, but hard to solve. It also has a
special place in the history of optimization, as many techniques that are now
used generally were first developed for the TSP. If you have not done so yet, I
recommend watching
[this talk by Bill Cook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VjphFYQKj8), or even
reading the book
[In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691163529/in-pursuit-of-the-traveling-salesman).

| This example shows why Mixed Integer Programming solvers are so good in solving the TSP. The linear relaxation (at the top) is already very close to the optimal solution. By branching, i.e., trying 0 and 1, on just two fractional variables, we not only find the optimal solution but can also prove optimality. The example was generated with the [DIY TSP Solver](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/D3/bootQ.html). |

#### `add_circuit`

The `add_circuit` constraint is utilized to solve circuit problems within
directed graphs, even allowing loops. It operates by taking a list of triples
`(u,v,var)`, where `u` and `v` denote the source and target vertices,
respectively, and `var` is a Boolean variable that indicates if an edge is
included in the solution. The constraint ensures that the edges marked as `True`
form a single circuit visiting each vertex exactly once, aside from vertices
with a loop set as `True`. Vertex indices should start at 0 and must not be
skipped to avoid isolation and infeasibility in the circuit.

Here is an example using the CP-SAT solver to address a directed Traveling
Salesperson Problem (TSP):

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# Directed graph with weighted edges
dgraph = {(0, 1): 13, (1, 0): 17, ...(2, 3): 27}

# Initialize CP-SAT model
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Boolean variables for each edge
edge_vars = {(u, v): model.new_bool_var(f"e_{u}_{v}") for (u, v) in dgraph.keys()}

# Circuit constraint for a single tour
model.add_circuit([(u, v, var) for (u, v), var in edge_vars.items()])

# Objective function to minimize total cost
model.minimize(sum(dgraph[(u, v)] * x for (u, v), x in edge_vars.items()))

# Solve model
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.solve(model)
if status in (cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE):
    tour = [(u, v) for (u, v), x in edge_vars.items() if solver.value(x)]
    print("Tour:", tour)

# Output: [(0, 1), (2, 0), (3, 2), (1, 3)], i.e., 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0
```

This constraint can be adapted for paths by adding a virtual enforced edge that
closes the path into a circuit, such as `(3, 0, 1)` for a path from vertex 0 to
vertex 3.

#### Creative usage of `add_circuit`

The `add_circuit` constraint can be creatively adapted to solve various related
problems. While there are more efficient algorithms for solving the Shortest
Path Problem, let us demonstrate how to adapt the `add_circuit` constraint for
educational purposes.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# Define a weighted, directed graph with edge costs
dgraph = {(0, 1): 13, (1, 0): 17, ...(2, 3): 27}

source_vertex = 0
target_vertex = 3

# Add zero-cost loops for vertices not being the source or target
for v in [1, 2]:
    dgraph[(v, v)] = 0

# Initialize CP-SAT model and variables
model = cp_model.CpModel()
edge_vars = {(u, v): model.new_bool_var(f"e_{u}_{v}") for (u, v) in dgraph}

# Define the circuit including a pseudo-edge from target to source
circuit = [(u, v, var) for (u, v), var in edge_vars.items()] + [
    (target_vertex, source_vertex, 1)
]
model.add_circuit(circuit)

# Minimize total cost
model.minimize(sum(dgraph[(u, v)] * x for (u, v), x in edge_vars.items()))

# Solve and extract the path
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.solve(model)
if status in (cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE):
    path = [(u, v) for (u, v), x in edge_vars.items() if solver.value(x) and u != v]
    print("Path:", path)

# Output: [(0, 1), (1, 3)], i.e., 0 -> 1 -> 3
```

This approach showcases the flexibility of the `add_circuit` constraint for
various tour and path problems. Explore further examples:

- [Budget constrained tours](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/examples/add_circuit_budget.py):
  Optimize the largest possible tour within a specified budget.
- [Multiple tours](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/examples/add_circuit_multi_tour.py):
  Solve for $k$ minimal tours covering all vertices.

#### `add_multiple_circuit`

You can model multiple disjoint tours using several `add_circuit` constraints,
as demonstrated in
[this example](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/examples/add_circuit_multi_tour.py).
If all tours share a common depot (vertex 0), the `add_multiple_circuit`
constraint is an alternative. However, this constraint does not allow you to
specify the number of tours, nor can it determine to which tour a particular
edge belongs. Therefore, the `add_circuit` constraint is often a superior
choice. Although the arguments for both constraints are identical, vertex 0
serves a unique role as the depot where all tours commence and conclude.

#### Performance of `add_circuit` for the TSP

The table below displays the performance of the CP-SAT solver on various
instances of the TSPLIB, using the `add_circuit` constraint, under a 90-second
time limit. The performance can be considered reasonable, but can be easily
beaten by a Mixed Integer Programming solver.

There are two prominent formulations to model the Traveling Salesman Problem
(TSP) without an `add_circuit` constraint: the
[Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson (DFJ) formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Dantzig%E2%80%93Fulkerson%E2%80%93Johnson_formulation)
and the
[Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ) formulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem#Miller%E2%80%93Tucker%E2%80%93Zemlin_formulation[21]).
The DFJ formulation is generally regarded as more efficient due to its stronger
linear relaxation. However, it requires lazy constraints, which are not
supported by the CP-SAT solver. When implemented without lazy constraints, the
performance of the DFJ formulation is comparable to that of the MTZ formulation
in CP-SAT. Nevertheless, both formulations perform significantly worse than the
`add_circuit` constraint. This indicates the superiority of using the
`add_circuit` constraint for handling tours and paths in such problems. Unlike
end users, the `add_circuit` constraint can utilize lazy constraints internally,
offering a substantial advantage in solving the TSP.

### Automaton Constraints

Automaton constraints model finite state machines, enabling the representation
of feasible transitions between states. This is particularly useful in software
verification, where it is essential to ensure that a program follows a specified
sequence of states. Given the critical importance of verification in research,
there is likely a dedicated audience that appreciates this constraint. However,
others may prefer to proceed to the next section.

|                  ![Automaton Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/automaton.png)                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| An example of a finite state machine with four states and seven transitions. State 0 is the initial state, and state 3 is the final state. |

The automaton operates as follows: We have a list of integer variables
`transition_variables` that represent the transition values. Starting from the
`starting_state`, the next state is determined by the transition triple
`(state, transition_value, next_state)` matching the first transition variable.
If no such triple is found, the model is infeasible. This process repeats for
each subsequent transition variable. It is crucial that the final transition
leads to a final state (possibly via a loop); otherwise, the model remains
infeasible.

The state machine from the example can be modeled as follows:

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

transition_variables = [model.new_int_var(0, 2, f"transition_{i}") for i in range(4)]
transition_triples = [
    (0, 0, 1),  # If in state 0 and the transition value is 0, go to state 1
    (1, 0, 1),  # If in state 1 and the transition value is 0, stay in state 1
    (1, 1, 2),  # If in state 1 and the transition value is 1, go to state 2
    (2, 0, 0),  # If in state 2 and the transition value is 0, go to state 0
    (2, 1, 1),  # If in state 2 and the transition value is 1, go to state 1
    (2, 2, 3),  # If in state 2 and the transition value is 2, go to state 3
    (3, 0, 3),  # If in state 3 and the transition value is 0, stay in state 3
]

model.add_automaton(
    transition_variables=transition_variables,
    starting_state=0,
    final_states=[3],
    transition_triples=transition_triples,
)
```

The assignment `[0, 1, 2, 0]` would be a feasible solution for this model,
whereas the assignment `[1, 0, 1, 2]` would be infeasible because state 0 has no
transition for value 1. Similarly, the assignment `[0, 0, 1, 1]` would be
infeasible as it does not end in a final state.

### Reservoir Constraints

Sometimes, we need to keep the balance between inflows and outflows of a
reservoir. The name giving example is a water reservoir, where we need to keep
the water level between a minimum and a maximum level. However, there are many
other examples, such as maintaining a certain stock level in a warehouse, or
ensuring a certain staffing level in a clinic. The `add_reservoir_constraint`
constraint in CP-SAT allows you to model such problems easily. It takes a list
of time variables, a list of change variables, and the minimum and maximum level
of the reservoir. `time_vars[i]` represents the time at which the change
`change_vars[i]` will be applied, thus both lists needs to be of the same
length. The reservoir level starts at 0, and the minimum level has to $\leq 0$
and the maximum level has to $\geq 0$.

```python
time_vars = [model.new_int_var(0, 100, f"time_{i}") for i in range(10)]
change_vars = [model.new_int_var(-10, 10, f"change_{i}") for i in range(10)]

model.add_reservoir_constraint(
    time_vars=time_vars,
    change_vars=change_vars,
    min_level=-20,
    max_level=20,
)
```

Additionally, the `add_reservoir_constraint_with_active` constraint allows you
to model a reservoir with _optional_ changes. Here, we additionally have a list
of Boolean variables `active_vars`, where `active_vars[i]` indicates if the
change `change_vars[i]` takes place. If a change is not active, it is as if it
does not exist, and the reservoir level remains the same, independent of the
time and change values.

```python
time_vars = [model.new_int_var(0, 100, f"time_{i}") for i in range(10)]
change_vars = [model.new_int_var(-10, 10, f"change_{i}") for i in range(10)]
active_vars = [model.new_bool_var(f"active_{i}") for i in range(10)]

model.add_reservoir_constraint_with_active(
    time_vars=time_vars,
    change_vars=change_vars,
    active_vars=active_vars,
    min_level=-20,
    max_level=20,
)
```

### Scheduling and Packing with Intervals

A special case of variables are the interval variables, that allow to model
intervals, i.e., a span of some length with a start and an end. There are fixed
length intervals, flexible length intervals, and optional intervals to model
various use cases. These intervals become interesting in combination with the
no-overlap constraints for 1D and 2D. We can use this for geometric packing
problems, scheduling problems, and many other problems, where we have to prevent
overlaps between intervals. These variables are special because they are
actually not a variable, but a container that bounds separately defined start,
length, and end variables.

There are four types of interval variables: `new_interval_var`,
`new_fixed_size_interval_var`, `new_optional_interval_var`, and
`new_optional_fixed_size_interval_var`. The `new_optional_interval_var` is the
most expressive but also the most expensive, while `new_fixed_size_interval_var`
is the least expressive and the easiest to optimize. All four types take a
`start=` variable. Intervals with `fixed_size` in their name require a constant
`size=` argument defining the interval length. Otherwise, the `size=` argument
can be a variable in combination with an `end=` variable, which complicates the
solution. Intervals with `optional` in their name include an `is_present=`
argument, a boolean indicating if the interval is present. The no-overlap
constraints, discussed later, apply only to intervals that are present, allowing
for modeling problems with multiple resources or optional tasks. Instead of a
pure integer variable, all arguments also accept an affine expression, e.g.,
`start=5*start_var+3`.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

start_var = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "start")
length_var = model.new_int_var(10, 20, "length")
end_var = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "end")
is_present_var = model.new_bool_var("is_present")

# creating an interval whose length can be influenced by a variable (more expensive)
flexible_interval = model.new_interval_var(
    start=start_var, size=length_var, end=end_var, name="flexible_interval"
)

# creating an interval of fixed length
fixed_interval = model.new_fixed_size_interval_var(
    start=start_var,
    size=10,  # needs to be a constant
    name="fixed_interval",
)

# creating an interval that can be present or not and whose length can be influenced by a variable (most expensive)
optional_interval = model.new_optional_interval_var(
    start=start_var,
    size=length_var,
    end=end_var,
    is_present=is_present_var,
    name="optional_interval",
)

# creating an interval that can be present or not
optional_fixed_interval = model.new_optional_fixed_size_interval_var(
    start=start_var,
    size=10,  # needs to be a constant
    is_present=is_present_var,
    name="optional_fixed_interval",
)
```

These interval variables are not useful on their own, as we could have easily
achieved the same with a simple linear constraint. However, CP-SAT provides
special constraints for these interval variables, that would actually be much
harder to model by hand and are also much more efficient.

CP-SAT offers the following three constraints for intervals:
`add_no_overlap`,`add_no_overlap_2d`, `add_cumulative`. `add_no_overlap` is used
to prevent overlaps between intervals on a single dimension, e.g., time.
`add_no_overlap_2d` is used to prevent overlaps between intervals on two
dimensions, e.g., for packing rectangles. `add_cumulative` is used to model a
resource constraint, where the sum of the demands of the overlapping intervals
must not exceed the capacity of the resource.

The `add_no_overlap` constraints takes a list of (optional) interval variables
and ensures that no two present intervals overlap.

```python
model.add_no_overlap(
    interval_vars=[
        flexible_interval,
        fixed_interval,
        optional_interval,
        optional_fixed_interval,
        # ...
    ]
)
```

The `add_no_overlap_2d` constraints takes two lists of (optional) interval and
ensures that for every `i` and `j` either `x_intervals[i]` and `x_intervals[j]`
or `y_intervals[i]` and `y_intervals[j]` do not overlap. Thus, both lists must
have the same length as `x_intervals[i]` and `y_intervals[i]` are considered
belonging together. If either `x_intervals[i]` or `y_intervals[i]` are optional,
the whole object is optional.

```python
model.add_no_overlap_2d(
    x_intervals=[
        flexible_interval,
        fixed_interval,
        optional_interval,
        optional_fixed_interval,
        # ...
    ],
    y_intervals=[
        flexible_interval,
        fixed_interval,
        optional_interval,
        optional_fixed_interval,
        # ...
    ],
)
```

The `add_cumulative` constraint is used to model a resource constraint, where
the sum of the demands of the overlapping intervals must not exceed the capacity
of the resource. An example could be scheduling the usage of certain energy
intensive machines, where the sum of the energy demands must not exceed the
capacity of the power grid. It takes a list of intervals, a list of demands, and
a capacity variable. The list of demands must have the same length as the list
of intervals, as the demands of the intervals are matched by index. As capacity
and demands can be variables (or affine expressions), quite complex resource
constraints can be modeled.

```python
demand_vars = [model.new_int_var(1, 10, f"demand_{i}") for i in range(4)]
capacity_var = model.new_int_var(1, 100, "capacity")
model.add_cumulative(
    intervals=[
        flexible_interval,
        fixed_interval,
        optional_interval,
        optional_fixed_interval,
    ],
    demands=demand_vars,
    capacity=capacity_var,
)
```

Let us examine a few examples of how to use these constraints effectively.

#### Scheduling for a Conference Room with Intervals

Assume we have a conference room and need to schedule several meetings. Each
meeting has a fixed length and a range of possible start times. The time slots
are in 5-minute intervals starting at 8:00 AM and ending at 6:00 PM. Thus, there
are $10 \times 12 = 120$ time slots, and we can use a simple integer variable to
model the start time. With fixed meeting lengths, we can use the
`new_fixed_size_interval_var` to model the intervals. The `add_no_overlap`
constraint ensures no two meetings overlap, and domains for the start time can
model the range of possible start times.

To handle input data, let us define a `namedtuple` to store the meeting and two
functions to convert between time and index.

```python
# Convert time to index and back
def t_to_idx(hour, minute):
    return (hour - 8) * 12 + minute // 5


def idx_to_t(time_idx):
    hour = 8 + time_idx // 12
    minute = (time_idx % 12) * 5
    return f"{hour}:{minute:02d}"


# Define meeting information using namedtuples
MeetingInfo = namedtuple("MeetingInfo", ["start_times", "duration"])
```

Then let us create a few meetings we want to schedule.

```python
# Meeting definitions
meetings = {
    "meeting_a": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[
            [t_to_idx(8, 0), t_to_idx(12, 0)],
            [t_to_idx(16, 0), t_to_idx(17, 0)],
        ],
        duration=120 // 5,  # 2 hours
    ),
    "meeting_b": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[
            [t_to_idx(10, 0), t_to_idx(12, 0)],
        ],
        duration=30 // 5,  # 30 minutes
    ),
    "meeting_c": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[
            [t_to_idx(16, 0), t_to_idx(17, 0)],
        ],
        duration=15 // 5,  # 15 minutes
    ),
    "meeting_d": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[
            [t_to_idx(8, 0), t_to_idx(10, 0)],
            [t_to_idx(12, 0), t_to_idx(14, 0)],
        ],
        duration=60 // 5,  # 1 hour
    ),
}
```

Now we can create the CP-SAT model and add the intervals and constraints.

```python
# Create a new CP-SAT model
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Create start time variables for each meeting
start_time_vars = {
    meeting_name: model.new_int_var_from_domain(
        cp_model.Domain.from_intervals(meeting_info.start_times),
        f"start_{meeting_name}",
    )
    for meeting_name, meeting_info in meetings.items()
}

# Create interval variables for each meeting
interval_vars = {
    meeting_name: model.new_fixed_size_interval_var(
        start=start_time_vars[meeting_name],
        size=meeting_info.duration,
        name=f"interval_{meeting_name}",
    )
    for meeting_name, meeting_info in meetings.items()
}

# Ensure that now two meetings overlap
model.add_no_overlap(list(interval_vars.values()))
```

And finally, we can solve the model and extract the solution.

```python
# Solve the model
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.solve(model)

# Extract and print the solution
scheduled_times = {}
if status in (cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE):
    for meeting_name in meetings:
        start_time = solver.value(start_time_vars[meeting_name])
        scheduled_times[meeting_name] = start_time
        print(f"{meeting_name} starts at {idx_to_t(start_time)}")
else:
    print("No feasible solution found.")
```

Doing some quick magic with matplotlib, we can visualize the schedule.

|                ![Schedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/scheduling_example.png)                |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| A possible non-overlapping schedule for the above example. The instance is quite simple, but you could try adding some more meetings. |

#### Scheduling for Multiple Resources with Optional Intervals

Now, imagine we have multiple resources, such as multiple conference rooms, and
we need to schedule the meetings such that no two meetings overlap in the same
room. This can be modeled with optional intervals, where the intervals exist
only if the meeting is scheduled in the room. The `add_no_overlap` constraint
ensures that no two meetings overlap in the same room.

Because we now have two rooms, we need to create a more challenging instance
first. Otherwise, the solver may not need to use both rooms. We do this by
simply adding more and longer meetings.

```python
# Meeting definitions
meetings = {
    "meeting_a": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[
            [t_to_idx(8, 0), t_to_idx(12, 0)],
            [t_to_idx(16, 0), t_to_idx(16, 0)],
        ],
        duration=120 // 5,
    ),
    "meeting_b": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[[t_to_idx(10, 0), t_to_idx(12, 0)]], duration=240 // 5
    ),
    "meeting_c": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[[t_to_idx(16, 0), t_to_idx(17, 0)]], duration=30 // 5
    ),
    "meeting_d": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[
            [t_to_idx(8, 0), t_to_idx(10, 0)],
            [t_to_idx(12, 0), t_to_idx(14, 0)],
        ],
        duration=60 // 5,
    ),
    "meeting_e": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[[t_to_idx(10, 0), t_to_idx(12, 0)]], duration=120 // 5
    ),
    "meeting_f": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[[t_to_idx(14, 0), t_to_idx(14, 0)]], duration=240 // 5
    ),
    "meeting_g": MeetingInfo(
        start_times=[[t_to_idx(14, 0), t_to_idx(16, 0)]], duration=120 // 5
    ),
}
```

This time, we need to create an interval variable for each room and meeting, as
well as a Boolean variable indicating if the meeting is scheduled in the room.
We cannot use the same interval variable for multiple rooms, as otherwise the
interval would be present in both rooms.

```python
# Create the model
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Create start time and room variables
start_time_vars = {
    name: model.new_int_var_from_domain(
        cp_model.Domain.from_intervals(info.start_times), f"start_{name}"
    )
    for name, info in meetings.items()
}

rooms = ["room_a", "room_b"]
room_vars = {
    name: {room: model.new_bool_var(f"{name}_in_{room}") for room in rooms}
    for name in meetings
}

# Create interval variables and add no-overlap constraint
interval_vars = {
    name: {
        # We need a separate interval for each room
        room: model.new_optional_fixed_size_interval_var(
            start=start_time_vars[name],
            size=info.duration,
            is_present=room_vars[name][room],
            name=f"interval_{name}_in_{room}",
        )
        for room in rooms
    }
    for name, info in meetings.items()
}
```

Now we can enforce that each meeting is assigned to exactly one room and that
there is no overlap between meetings in the same room.

```python
# Ensure each meeting is assigned to exactly one room
for name, room_dict in room_vars.items():
    model.add_exactly_one(room_dict.values())

for room in rooms:
    model.add_no_overlap([interval_vars[name][room] for name in meetings])
```

Again, doing some quick magic with matplotlib, we get the following schedule.

| ![Schedule multiple rooms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/scheduling_multiple_resources.png) |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                          A possible non-overlapping schedule for the above example with multiple rooms.                           |

#### Packing rectangles without overlaps

Let us examine how to check if a set of rectangles can be packed into a
container without overlaps. This is a common problem in logistics, where boxes
must be packed into a container, or in cutting stock problems, where pieces are
cut from a larger material.

First, we define namedtuples for the rectangles and the container.

```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Define namedtuples for rectangles and container
Rectangle = namedtuple("Rectangle", ["width", "height"])
Container = namedtuple("Container", ["width", "height"])

# Example usage
rectangles = [Rectangle(width=2, height=3), Rectangle(width=4, height=5)]
container = Container(width=10, height=10)
```

Next, we create variables for the bottom-left corners of the rectangles. These
variables are constrained to ensure the rectangles remain within the container.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Create variables for the bottom-left corners of the rectangles
x_vars = [
    model.new_int_var(0, container.width - box.width, name=f"x1_{i}")
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]
y_vars = [
    model.new_int_var(0, container.height - box.height, name=f"y1_{i}")
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]
```

Next, we create interval variables for each rectangle. The start of these
intervals corresponds to the bottom-left corner, and the size is the width or
height of the rectangle. We use the `add_no_overlap_2d` constraint to ensure
that no two rectangles overlap.

```python
# Create interval variables representing the width and height of the rectangles
x_interval_vars = [
    model.new_fixed_size_interval_var(
        start=x_vars[i], size=box.width, name=f"x_interval_{i}"
    )
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]
y_interval_vars = [
    model.new_fixed_size_interval_var(
        start=y_vars[i], size=box.height, name=f"y_interval_{i}"
    )
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]

# Ensure no two rectangles overlap
model.add_no_overlap_2d(x_interval_vars, y_interval_vars)
```

The optional intervals with flexible length allow us to model rotations and find
the largest possible packing. The code may appear complex, but it remains
straightforward considering the problem's complexity.

First, we define namedtuples for the rectangles and the container.

```python
from collections import namedtuple
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

# Define namedtuples for rectangles and container
Rectangle = namedtuple("Rectangle", ["width", "height", "value"])
Container = namedtuple("Container", ["width", "height"])

# Example usage
rectangles = [
    Rectangle(width=2, height=3, value=1),
    Rectangle(width=4, height=5, value=1),
]
container = Container(width=10, height=10)
```

Next, we create variables for the coordinates of the rectangles. This includes
variables for the bottom-left and top-right corners, as well as a boolean
variable to indicate if a rectangle is rotated.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Create variables for the bottom-left and top-right corners of the rectangles
bottom_left_x_vars = [
    model.new_int_var(0, container.width, name=f"x1_{i}")
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]
bottom_left_y_vars = [
    model.new_int_var(0, container.height, name=f"y1_{i}")
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]
upper_right_x_vars = [
    model.new_int_var(0, container.width, name=f"x2_{i}")
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]
upper_right_y_vars = [
    model.new_int_var(0, container.height, name=f"y2_{i}")
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]

# Create variables to indicate if a rectangle is rotated
rotated_vars = [model.new_bool_var(f"rotated_{i}") for i in range(len(rectangles))]
```

We then create variables for the width and height of each rectangle, adjusting
for rotation. Constraints ensure these variables are set correctly based on
whether the rectangle is rotated.

```python
# Create variables for the width and height, adjusted for rotation
width_vars = []
height_vars = []
for i, box in enumerate(rectangles):
    domain = cp_model.Domain.from_values([box.width, box.height])
    width_vars.append(model.new_int_var_from_domain(domain, name=f"width_{i}"))
    height_vars.append(model.new_int_var_from_domain(domain, name=f"height_{i}"))
    # There are two possible assignments for width and height
    model.add_allowed_assignments(
        [width_vars[i], height_vars[i], rotated_vars[i]],
        [(box.width, box.height, 0), (box.height, box.width, 1)],
    )
```

Next, we create a boolean variable indicating if a rectangle is packed or not,
and then interval variables representing its occupied space in the container.
These intervals are used to enforce the no-overlap constraint.

```python
# Create variables indicating if a rectangle is packed
packed_vars = [model.new_bool_var(f"packed_{i}") for i in range(len(rectangles))]

# Create interval variables representing the width and height of the rectangles
x_interval_vars = [
    model.new_optional_interval_var(
        start=bottom_left_x_vars[i],
        size=width_vars[i],
        is_present=packed_vars[i],
        end=upper_right_x_vars[i],
        name=f"x_interval_{i}",
    )
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]
y_interval_vars = [
    model.new_optional_interval_var(
        start=bottom_left_y_vars[i],
        size=height_vars[i],
        is_present=packed_vars[i],
        end=upper_right_y_vars[i],
        name=f"y_interval_{i}",
    )
    for i, box in enumerate(rectangles)
]

# Ensure no two rectangles overlap
model.add_no_overlap_2d(x_interval_vars, y_interval_vars)
```

Finally, we maximize the number of packed rectangles by defining an objective
function.

```python
# Maximize the number of packed rectangles
model.maximize(sum(box.value * x for x, box in zip(packed_vars, rectangles)))
```

CP-SAT is good at finding a feasible packing, but incapable of proofing
infeasibility in most cases. When using the knapsack variant, it can still pack
most of the rectangles even for the larger instances.

#### Resolution and Parameters

In earlier versions of CP-SAT, the performance of no-overlap constraints was
greatly influenced by the resolution. This impact has evolved, yet it remains
somewhat inconsistent. In a notebook example, I explored how resolution affects
the execution time of the no-overlap constraint in versions 9.3 and 9.8 of
CP-SAT. For version 9.3, there is a noticeable increase in execution time as the
resolution grows. Conversely, in version 9.8, execution time actually reduces
when the resolution is higher, a finding supported by repeated tests. This
unexpected behavior suggests that the performance of CP-SAT regarding no-overlap
constraints has not stabilized and may continue to vary in upcoming versions.

| Resolution | Runtime (CP-SAT 9.3) | Runtime (CP-SAT 9.8) |
| ---------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1x         | 0.02s                | 0.03s                |
| 10x        | 0.7s                 | 0.02s                |
| 100x       | 7.6s                 | 1.1s                 |
| 1000x      | 75s                  | 40.3s                |
| 10_000x    | >15min               | 0.4s                 |

[This notebook](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/examples/add_no_overlap_2d.ipynb)
was used to create the table above.

However, while playing around with less documented features, I noticed that the
performance for the older version can be improved drastically with the following
parameters:

```python
solver.parameters.use_energetic_reasoning_in_no_overlap_2d = True
solver.parameters.use_timetabling_in_no_overlap_2d = True
solver.parameters.use_pairwise_reasoning_in_no_overlap_2d = True
```

With the latest version of CP-SAT, I did not notice a significant difference in
performance when using these parameters.

### Non-Linear Constraints/Piecewise Linear Functions

In practice, you often have cost functions that are not linear. For example,
consider a production problem where you have three different items you produce.
Each item has different components, you have to buy. The cost of the components
will first decrease with the amount you buy, then at some point increase again
as your supplier will be out of stock and you have to buy from a more expensive
supplier. Additionally, you only have a certain amount of customers willing to
pay a certain price for your product. If you want to sell more, you will have to
lower the price, which will decrease your profit.

Let us assume such a function looks like $y=f(x)$ in the following figure.
Unfortunately, it is a rather complex function that we cannot directly express
in CP-SAT. However, we can approximate it with a piecewise linear function as
shown in red. Such piecewise linear approximations are very common, and some
solvers can even do them automatically, e.g., Gurobi. The resolution can be
arbitrarily high, but the more segments you have, the more complex the model
becomes. Thus, it is usually only chosen to be as high as necessary.

|                                                                                                                     ![./images/pwla.png](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/images/pwla.png)                                                                                                                      |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| We can model an arbitrary continuous function with a piecewise linear function. Here, we split the original function into a number of straight segments. The accuracy can be adapted to the requirements. The linear segments can then be expressed in CP-SAT. The fewer such segments, the easier it remains to model and solve. |

Using linear constraints (`model.add`) and reification (`.only_enforce_if`), we
can model such a piecewise linear function in CP-SAT. For this we simply use
boolean variables to decide for a segment, and then activate the corresponding
linear constraint via reification. However, this has two problems in CP-SAT, as
shown in the next figure.

|                                                                                                             ![./images/pwla_problems.png](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/images/pwla_problems.png)                                                                                                              |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Even if the function f(x) now consists of linear segments, we cannot simply implement $y=f(x)$ in CP-SAT. First, for many $x$-values, $f(x)$ will be not integral and, thus, infeasible. Second, the canonical representation of many linear segments will require non-integral coefficients, which are also not allowed in CP-SAT. |

- **Problem A:** Even if we can express a segment as a linear function, the
  result of the function may not be integral. In the example, $f(5)$ would be
  $3.5$ and, thus, if we enforce $y=f(x)$, $x$ would be prohibited to be $5$,
  which is not what we want. There are two options now. Either, we use a more
  complex piecewise linear approximation that ensures that the function will
  always yield integral solutions or we use inequalities instead. The first
  solution has the issue that this can require too many segments, making it far
  too expensive to optimize. The second solution will be a weaker constraint as
  now we can only enforce $y<=f(x)$ or $y>=f(x)$, but not $y=f(x)$. If you try
  to enforce it by $y<=f(x)$ and $y>=f(x)$, you will end with the same
  infeasibility as before. However, often an inequality will be enough. If the
  problem is to prevent $y$ from becoming too large, you use $y<=f(x)$, if the
  problem is to prevent $y$ from becoming too small, you use $y>=f(x)$. If we
  want to represent the costs by $f(x)$, we would use $y>=f(x)$ to minimize the
  costs.

- **Problem B:** The canonical representation of a linear function is $y=ax+b$.
  However, this will often require non-integral coefficients. Luckily, we can
  automatically scale them up to integral values by adding a scaling factor. The
  inequality $y=0.5x+0.5$ in the example can also be represented as $2y=x+1$. I
  will spare you the math, but it just requires a simple trick with the least
  common multiple. Of course, the required scaling factor can become large, and
  at some point lead to overflows.

An implementation could now look as follows:

```python
# We want to enforce y=f(x)
x = model.new_int_var(0, 7, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(0, 5, "y")

# use boolean variables to decide for a segment
segment_active = [model.new_bool_var("segment_1"), model.new_bool_var("segment_2")]
model.add_at_most_one(segment_active)  # enforce one segment to be active

# Segment 1
# if 0<=x<=3, then y >= 0.5*x + 0.5
model.add(2 * y >= x + 1).only_enforce_if(segment_active[0])
model.add(x >= 0).only_enforce_if(segment_active[0])
model.add(x <= 3).only_enforce_if(segment_active[0])

# Segment 2
model.add(_SLIGHTLY_MORE_COMPLEX_INEQUALITY_).only_enforce_if(segment_active[1])
model.add(x >= 3).only_enforce_if(segment_active[1])
model.add(x <= 7).only_enforce_if(segment_active[1])

model.minimize(y)
# if we were to maximize y, we would have used <= instead of >=
```

This can be quite tedious, but luckily, I wrote a small helper class that will
do this automatically for you. You can find it in
[./utils/piecewise_functions](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/utils/piecewise_functions/).
Simply copy it into your code.

This code does some further optimizations:

1. Considering every segment as a separate case can be quite expensive and
   inefficient. Thus, it can make a serious difference if you can combine
   multiple segments into a single case. This can be achieved by detecting
   convex ranges, as the constraints of convex areas do not interfere with each
   other.
2. Adding the convex hull of the segments as a redundant constraint that does
   not depend on any `only_enforce_if` can in some cases help the solver to find
   better bounds. `only_enforce_if`-constraints are often not very good for the
   linear relaxation, and having the convex hull as independent constraint can
   directly limit the solution space, without having to do any branching on the
   cases.

Let us use this code to solve an instance of the problem above.

We have two products that each require three components. The first product
requires 3 of component 1, 5 of component 2, and 2 of component 3. The second
product requires 2 of component 1, 1 of component 2, and 3 of component 3. We
can buy up to 1500 of each component for the price given in the figure below. We
can produce up to 300 of each product and sell them for the price given in the
figure below.

|                                                Costs for buying components necessary for production.                                                 |                                                         Selling price for the products.                                                          |

We want to maximize the profit, i.e., the selling price minus the costs for
buying the components. We can model this as follows:

```python
requirements_1 = (3, 5, 2)
requirements_2 = (2, 1, 3)

from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()
buy_1 = model.new_int_var(0, 1_500, "buy_1")
buy_2 = model.new_int_var(0, 1_500, "buy_2")
buy_3 = model.new_int_var(0, 1_500, "buy_3")

produce_1 = model.new_int_var(0, 300, "produce_1")
produce_2 = model.new_int_var(0, 300, "produce_2")

model.add(produce_1 * requirements_1[0] + produce_2 * requirements_2[0] <= buy_1)
model.add(produce_1 * requirements_1[1] + produce_2 * requirements_2[1] <= buy_2)
model.add(produce_1 * requirements_1[2] + produce_2 * requirements_2[2] <= buy_3)

# You can find this code it ./utils!
from piecewise_functions import PiecewiseLinearFunction, PiecewiseLinearConstraint

# Define the functions for the costs
costs_1 = [(0, 0), (1000, 400), (1500, 1300)]
costs_2 = [(0, 0), (300, 300), (700, 500), (1200, 600), (1500, 1100)]

)
f_costs_2 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_2], ys=[y for x, y in costs_2]
)
f_costs_3 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_3], ys=[y for x, y in costs_3]
)

# Define the functions for the gain
gain_1 = [(0, 0), (100, 800), (200, 1600), (300, 2_000)]
gain_2 = [(0, 0), (80, 1_000), (150, 1_300), (200, 1_400), (300, 1_500)]
f_gain_1 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[x for x, y in gain_1], ys=[y for x, y in gain_1])
f_gain_2 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[x for x, y in gain_2], ys=[y for x, y in gain_2])

# Create y>=f(x) constraints for the costs
x_costs_1 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_1, f_costs_1, upper_bound=False)
x_costs_2 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_2, f_costs_2, upper_bound=False)
x_costs_3 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_3, f_costs_3, upper_bound=False)

# Create y<=f(x) constraints for the gain
x_gain_1 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, produce_1, f_gain_1, upper_bound=True)
x_gain_2 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, produce_2, f_gain_2, upper_bound=True)

# Maximize the gain minus the costs
model.Maximize(x_gain_1.y + x_gain_2.y - (x_costs_1.y + x_costs_2.y + x_costs_3.y))

solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
solver.parameters.log_search_progress = True
status = solver.solve(model)
print(f"Buy {solver.value(buy_1)} of component 1")
print(f"Buy {solver.value(buy_2)} of component 2")
print(f"Buy {solver.value(buy_3)} of component 3")
print(f"Produce {solver.value(produce_1)} of product 1")
print(f"Produce {solver.value(produce_2)} of product 2")
print(f"Overall gain: {solver.objective_value}")
```

This will give you the following output:

```
Buy 930 of component 1
Buy 1200 of component 2
Buy 870 of component 3
Produce 210 of product 1
Produce 150 of product 2
Overall gain: 1120.0
```

Unfortunately, these problems quickly get very complicated to model and solve.
This is just a proof that, theoretically, you can model such problems in CP-SAT.
Practically, you can lose a lot of time and sanity with this if you are not an
expert.

implemented via
[Protocol Buffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) and can be
manipulated via the `parameters`-member. If you want to find out all options,
you can check the reasonably well documented `proto`-file in the

I will give you the most important right below.

### Time limit and Status

If we have a huge model, CP-SAT may not be able to solve it to optimality (if
the constraints are not too difficult, there is a good chance we still get a
good solution). Of course, we do not want CP-SAT to run endlessly for hours
(years, decades,...) but simply abort after a fixed time and return us the best
solution so far. If you are now asking yourself why you should use a tool that
may run forever: There are simply no provably faster algorithms and considering
the combinatorial complexity, it is incredible that it works so well. Those not
familiar with the concepts of NP-hardness and combinatorial complexity, I
recommend reading the book 'In Pursuit of the Traveling Salesman' by William
Cook. Actually, I recommend this book to anyone into optimization: It is a
beautiful and light weekend-read.

To set a time limit (in seconds), we can simply set the following value before
we run the solver:

```python
solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = 60  # 60s timelimit
```

We now of course have the problem, that maybe we will not have an optimal
solution, or a solution at all, we can continue on. Thus, we need to check the
status of the solver.

```python
status = solver.Solve(model)
if status == cp_model.OPTIMAL or status == cp_model.FEASIBLE:
    print("We have a solution.")
else:
    print("Help?! No solution available! :( ")
```

The following status codes are possible:

- `OPTIMAL`: Perfect, we have an optimal solution.
- `FEASIBLE`: Good, we have at least a feasible solution (we may also have a
  bound available to check the quality via `solver.BestObjectiveBound()`).
- `INFEASIBLE`: There is a proof that no solution can satisfy all our
  constraints.
- `MODEL_INVALID`: You used CP-SAT wrongly.
- `UNKNOWN`: No solution was found, but also no infeasibility proof. Thus, we
  actually know nothing. Maybe there is at least a bound available?

If you want to print the status, you can use `solver.StatusName(status)`.

We can not only limit the runtime but also tell CP-SAT, we are satisfied with a
solution within a specific, provable quality range. For this, we can set the
parameters `absolute_gap_limit` and `relative_gap_limit`. The absolute limit
tells CP-SAT to stop as soon as the solution is at most a specific value apart
to the bound, the relative limit is relative to the bound. More specifically,
CP-SAT will stop as soon as the objective value(O) is within relative ratio
$abs(O - B) / max(1, abs(O))$ of the bound (B). To stop as soon as we are within
5% of the optimum, we could state (TODO: Check)

```python
solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = 0.05
```

Now we may want to stop after we did not make progress for some time or
whatever. In this case, we can make use of the solution callbacks.

For adding a solution callback, we have to inherit from a base class. The
documentation of the base class and the available operations can be found in the
[documentation](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model#cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback).

```python
class MySolutionCallback(cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback):
    def __init__(self, stuff):
        cp_model.CpSolverSolutionCallback.__init__(self)
        self.stuff = stuff  # just to show that we can save some data in the callback.

    def on_solution_callback(self):
        obj = self.ObjectiveValue()  # best solution value
        bound = self.BestObjectiveBound()  # best bound
        print(f"The current value of x is {self.Value(x)}")
        if abs(obj - bound) < 10:
            self.StopSearch()  # abort search for better solution
        # ...


solver.Solve(model, MySolutionCallback(None))
```

You can find an
[official example of using such callbacks](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/ortools/sat/samples/stop_after_n_solutions_sample_sat.py)
.

Beside querying the objective value of the currently best solution, the solution
itself, and the best known bound, you can also find out about internals such as
`NumBooleans(self)`, `NumConflicts(self)`, `NumBranches(self)`. What those
values mean will be discussed later.

With version 9.10, CP-SAT also supports bound callbacks. These are called when
CP-SAT is able to improve the proven bound. As the solution callback is only
called when a new solution is found, you may want to additionally use the bound
callback when you want to abort the search as soon as the bound is good enough.

```python
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()


def bound_callback(bound):
    print(f"New bound: {bound}")
    if bound > 100:
        solver.StopSearch()


solver.best_bound_callback = bound_callback
```

You can also try to directly hook into the log output of CP-SAT, which should be
called for new solutions, new bounds, and other important events. This can be
done by setting the `log_callback` parameter.

```python
solver.log_callback = lambda msg: print("LOG:", msg)  # (str)->None
```

### Parallelization

CP-SAT is a portfolio-solver that uses different techniques to solve the
problem. There is some information exchange between the different workers, but
it does not split the solution space into different parts, thus, it does not
parallelize the branch-and-bound algorithm as MIP-solvers do. This can lead to
some redundancy in the search, but running different techniques in parallel will
also increase the chance of running the right technique. Predicting which
technique will be the best for a specific problem is often hard, thus, this
parallelization can be quite useful.

You can control the parallelization of CP-SAT by setting the number of search
workers.

```python
solver.parameters.num_workers = 8  # use 8 cores
```

Here the solvers used by CP-SAT 9.9 on different parallelization levels for an
optimization problem and no additional specifications (e.g., decision
strategies). Note that some parameters/constraints/objectives can change the
parallelization strategy Also check

Important steps:

- With a single worker, only the default subsolver is used.
- With two workers or more, CP-SAT starts using incomplete subsolvers, i.e.,
  heuristics such as LNS.
- With five workers, CP-SAT will also have a first solution subsolver.
- With 23 workers, all 15 full problem subsolvers are used.
- For more than 32 workers, primarily the number of first solution subsolvers is
  increased.

**Full problem subsolvers** are solvers that search the full problem space,
e.g., by a branch-and-bound algorithm. Available full problem subsolvers are:

- `default_lp`: LCG-based search with default linearization of the model.
  - `max_lp`: Same as `default_lp` but with maximal linearization.
  - `no_lp`: Same as `default_lp` but without linearization.
- `lb_tree_search`: This solver is focussed on improving the proven bound, not
  on finding better solutions. By disproving the feasibility of the cheapest
  nodes in the search tree, it incrementally improves the bound, but has only
  little chances to find better solutions.
- `objective_lb_search`: Also focussed on improving the bound by disproving the
  feasibility of the current lower bound.
  - `objective_lb_search_max_lp`: With maximal linearization.
  - `objective_lb_search_no_lp`: Without linearization.
  - `objective_shaving_search_max_lp`: Should be quite similar to
    `objective_lb_search_max_lp`.
  - `objective_shaving_search_no_lp`: Should be quite similar to
    `objective_lb_search_no_lp`.
- `probing`: Fixing variables and seeing what happens.
  - `probing_max_lp`: Same as probing but with maximal linearization.
- `pseudo_costs`: Uses pseudo costs for branching, which are computed from
  historical changes in objective bounds following certain branching decisions.
- `quick_restart`: Restarts the search more eagerly. Restarts rebuild the search
  tree from scratch, but keep learned clauses. This allows to recover from bad
  decisions, and lead to smaller search trees by learning from the mistakes of
  the past.
  - `quick_restart_no_lp`: Same as `quick_restart` but without linearization.
- `reduced_costs`: Uses the reduced costs of the linear relaxation for
  branching.
- `core`: A strategy from the SAT-community that extracts unsatisfiable cores of
  the formula.
- `fixed`: User-specified search strategy.

You can specify the used full problem subsolvers manually by

```
# make sure list is empty
while solver.parameters.subsolvers:
   solver.parameters.subsolvers.pop()
# set new list
solver.parameters.subsolvers.extend(["default_lp", "fixed", "less_encoding", "no_lp", "max_lp", "pseudo_costs", "reduced_costs", "quick_restart", "quick_restart_no_lp", "lb_tree_search", "probing"])
```

This can be interesting, e.g., if you are using CP-SAT especially because the
linear relaxation is not useful (and the BnB-algorithm performing badly). There
are even more options, but for these you can simply look into the
[documentation](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/49b6301e1e1e231d654d79b6032e79809868a70e/ortools/sat/sat_parameters.proto#L513).
Be aware that fine-tuning such a solver is not a simple task, and often you do
more harm than good by tinkering around. However, I noticed that decreasing the
number of search workers can actually improve the runtime for some problems.
This indicates that at least selecting the right subsolvers that are best fitted
for your problem can be worth a shot. For example `max_lp` is probably a waste
of resources if you know that your model has a terrible linear relaxation. In
this context I want to recommend having a look on some relaxed solutions when
dealing with difficult problems to get a better understanding of which parts a
solver may struggle with (use a linear programming solver, like Gurobi, for
this).

You can evaluate the performance of the different strategies by looking at the
`Solutions` and `Objective bounds` blocks in the log. Here an example:

```
Solutions (7)             Num   Rank
                'no_lp':    3  [1,7]
        'quick_restart':    1  [3,3]
  'quick_restart_no_lp':    3  [2,5]

Objective bounds                     Num
                  'initial_domain':    1
             'objective_lb_search':    2
       'objective_lb_search_no_lp':    4
  'objective_shaving_search_no_lp':    1
```

For solutions, the first number is the number of solutions found by the
strategy, the second number is the range of the ranks of the solutions. The
value `[1,7]` indicates that the solutions found by the strategy have ranks
between 1 and 7. In this case, it means that the strategy `no_lp` found the best
and the worst solution.

For objective bounds, the number indicates how often the strategy contributed to
the best bound. For this example, it seems that the `no_lp` strategies are the
most successful. Note that for both cases, it is more interesting, which
strategies do not appear in the list.

In the search log, you can also see at which time which subsolver contributed
something. This log also includes the incomplete and first solution subsolvers.

```

**Incomplete subsolvers** are solvers that do not search the full problem space,
but work heuristically. Notable strategies are large neighborhood search (LNS)
and feasibility pumps. The first one tries to find a better solution by changing
only a few variables, the second one tries to make infeasible/incomplete
solutions feasible. You can also run only the incomplete subsolvers by setting
`solver.parameters.use_lns_only = True`, but this needs to be combined with a
time limit, as the incomplete subsolvers do not know when to stop.

**First solution subsolvers** are strategies that try to find a first solution
as fast as possible. They are often used to warm up the solver and to get a
first impression of the problem.

<!-- Source on Parallelization in Gurobi and general opportunities -->

If you are interested in how Gurobi parallelizes its search, you can find a
great video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJz1UxaMWRQ). Ed Rothberg
also explains the general opportunities and challenges of parallelizing a
solver, making it also interesting for understanding the parallelization of
CP-SAT.

#### Importing/Exporting Models for Comparison on Different Hardware

If you want to compare the performance of different parallelization levels or
different hardware, you can use the following code snippets to export a model.
Instead of having to rebuild the model or share any code, you can then simply
load the model on a different machine and run the solver.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from google.protobuf import text_format


def export_model(model: cp_model.CpModel, filename: str):
    with open(filename, "w") as file:
        file.write(text_format.MessageToString(model.Proto()))


def import_model(filename: str) -> cp_model.CpModel:
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    with open(filename, "r") as file:
        text_format.Parse(file.read(), model.Proto())
    return model
```

### Assumptions

Quite often you want to find out what happens if you force some variables to a
specific value. Because you possibly want to do that multiple times, you do not
want to copy the whole model. CP-SAT has a nice option of adding assumptions
that you can clear afterwards, without needing to copy the object to test the
next assumptions. This is a feature also known from many SAT-solvers and CP-SAT
also only allows this feature for boolean literals. You cannot add any more
complicated expressions here, but for boolean literals it seems to be pretty
efficient. By adding some auxiliary boolean variables, you can also use this
technique to play around with more complicated expressions without the need to
copy the model. If you really need to temporarily add complex constraints, you
may have to copy the model using `model.CopyFrom` (maybe you also need to copy
the variables. Need to check that.).

```python
model.AddAssumptions([b1, b2.Not()])  # assume b1=True, b2=False
model.AddAssumption(b3)  # assume b3=True (single literal)
# ... solve again and analyse ...
model.ClearAssumptions()  # clear all assumptions
```

> An **assumption** is a temporary fixation of a boolean variable to true or
> false. It can be efficiently handled by a SAT-solver (and thus probably also
> by CP-SAT) and does not harm the learned clauses (but can reuse them).

### Hints

Maybe we already have a good intuition on how the solution will look like (this
could be, because we already solved a similar model, have a good heuristic,
etc.). In this case it may be useful, to tell CP-SAT about it, so it can
incorporate this knowledge into its search. For Mixed Integer Programming
Solver, this often yields a visible boost, even with mediocre heuristic
solutions. For CP-SAT I actually also encountered downgrades of the performance
if the hints were not great (but this may depend on the problem).

```python
model.AddHint(x, 1)  # Tell CP-SAT that x will probably be 1
model.AddHint(y, 2)  # and y probably be 2.
```

You can also find
[an official example](https://github.com/google/or-tools/blob/stable/ortools/sat/samples/solution_hinting_sample_sat.py).

To make sure, your hints are actually correct, you can use the following
parameters to make CP-SAT throw an error if your hints are wrong.

```python
solver.parameters.debug_crash_on_bad_hint = True
```

If you have the feeling that your hints are not used, you may have made a
logical error in your model or just have a bug in your code. This parameter will
tell you about it.

(TODO: Have not tested this, yet)

### Logging

Sometimes it is useful to activate logging to see what is going on. This can be
achieved by setting the following two parameters.

```python
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

The log is actually very interesting to understand CP-SAT, but also to learn
about the optimization problem at hand. It gives you a lot of details on, e.g.,
how many variables could be directly removed or which techniques contributed to
lower and upper bounds the most.

As the log can be quite overwhelming, I developed a small tool to visualize and
comment the log. You can just copy and paste your log into it, and it will
automatically show you the most important details. Also be sure to check out the
examples in it.

### Decision Strategy

In the end of this section, a more advanced parameter that looks interesting for
advanced users as it gives some insights into the search algorithm, **but is
probably better left alone**.

We can tell CP-SAT, how to branch (or make a decision) whenever it can no longer
deduce anything via propagation. For this, we need to provide a list of the
variables (order may be important for some strategies), define which variable
should be selected next (fixed variables are automatically skipped), and define
which value should be probed.

We have the following options for variable selection:

- `CHOOSE_FIRST`: the first not-fixed variable in the list.
- `CHOOSE_LOWEST_MIN`: the variable that could (potentially) take the lowest
  value.
- `CHOOSE_HIGHEST_MAX`: the variable that could (potentially) take the highest
  value.
- `CHOOSE_MIN_DOMAIN_SIZE`: the variable that has the fewest feasible
  assignments.
- `CHOOSE_MAX_DOMAIN_SIZE`: the variable the has the most feasible assignments.

For the value/domain strategy, we have the options:

- `SELECT_MIN_VALUE`: try to assign the smallest value.
- `SELECT_MAX_VALUE`: try to assign the largest value.
- `SELECT_LOWER_HALF`: branch to the lower half.
- `SELECT_UPPER_HALF`: branch to the upper half.
- `SELECT_MEDIAN_VALUE`: try to assign the median value.

> **CAVEAT:** In the documentation there is a warning about the completeness of
> the domain strategy. I am not sure, if this is just for custom strategies or
> you have to be careful in general. So be warned.

```python
model.AddDecisionStrategy([x], cp_model.CHOOSE_FIRST, cp_model.SELECT_MIN_VALUE)

# your can force CP-SAT to follow this strategy exactly
solver.parameters.search_branching = cp_model.FIXED_SEARCH
```

For example for [coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring) (with
integer representation of the color), we could order the variables by decreasing
neighborhood size (`CHOOSE_FIRST`) and then always try to assign the lowest
color (`SELECT_MIN_VALUE`). This strategy should perform an implicit
kernelization, because if we need at least $k$ colors, the vertices with less
than $k$ neighbors are trivial (and they would not be relevant for any
conflict). Thus, by putting them at the end of the list, CP-SAT will only
consider them once the vertices with higher degree could be colored without any
conflict (and then the vertices with lower degree will, too). Another strategy
may be to use `CHOOSE_LOWEST_MIN` to always select the vertex that has the
lowest color available. Whether this will actually help, has to be evaluated:
CP-SAT will probably notice by itself which vertices are the critical ones after
some conflicts.

> :warning: I played around a little with selecting a manual search strategy.
> But even for the coloring, where this may even seem smart, it only gave an
> advantage for a bad model and after improving the model by symmetry breaking,
> it performed worse. Further, I assume that CP-SAT can learn the best strategy
> (Gurobi does such a thing, too) much better dynamically on its own.

## Coding Patterns for Optimization Problems

![Cover Image Patterns](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_4.webp)

In this section, we will explore various coding patterns that are essential for
structuring implementations for optimization problems using CP-SAT. While we
will not delve into the modeling of specific problems, our focus will be on
demonstrating how to organize your code to enhance its readability and
maintainability. These practices are crucial for developing robust and scalable
optimization solutions that can be easily understood, modified, and extended by
other developers. We will concentrate on basic patterns, as more complex
patterns are better understood within the context of larger problems and are
beyond the scope of this primer.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The naming conventions for patterns in optimization problems are not
> standardized. There is no comprehensive guide on coding patterns for
> optimization issues, and my insights are primarily based on personal
> experience. Most online examples tend to focus solely on the model, often

> [gurobi-optimods](https://github.com/Gurobi/gurobi-optimods) provide the
> closest examples to production-ready code that I am aware of, yet they offer
> limited guidance on code structuring. I aim to address this gap, which many
> find challenging, though it is important to note that my approach is **highly
> opinionated**.

### Simple Function

For straightforward optimization problems, encapsulating the model creation and
solving within a single function is a practical approach. This method is best
suited for simpler cases due to its straightforward nature but lacks flexibility
for more complex scenarios. Parameters such as the time limit and optimality
tolerance can be customized via keyword arguments with default values.

The following Python function demonstrates solving a simple knapsack problem
using CP-SAT. To recap, in the knapsack problem, we select items - each with a
specific weight and value - to maximize total value without exceeding a
predefined weight limit. Given its simplicity, involving only one constraint,
the knapsack problem serves as an ideal model for introductory examples.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from typing import List


def solve_knapsack(
    weights: List[int],
    values: List[int],
    capacity: int,
    *,
    time_limit: int = 900,
    opt_tol: float = 0.01,
) -> List[int]:
    # initialize the model
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    n = len(weights)  # Number of items
    # Decision variables for items
    x = [model.NewBoolVar(f"x_{i}") for i in range(n)]
    # Capacity constraint
    model.Add(sum(weights[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) <= capacity)
    # Objective function to maximize value
    model.Maximize(sum(values[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)))
    # Solve the model
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = time_limit  # Solver time limit
    solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = opt_tol  # Solver optimality tolerance
    status = solver.Solve(model)
    # Extract solution
    return (
        # Return indices of selected items
        [i for i in range(n) if solver.Value(x[i])]
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]
        else []
    )
```

### Logging the Model Building

When working with more complex optimization problems, logging the model-building
process can be essential to find and fix issues. Often, the problem lies not
within the solver but in the model itself.

In the following example, we add some basic logging to the solver function to
give us some insights into the model-building process. This logging can be
easily activated or deactivated by the logging framework, allowing us to use it
not only during development but also in production.

If you do not know about the logging framework of Python, this is an excellent
moment to learn about it. I consider it an essential skill for production code
and this and similar frameworks are used for most production code in any
language. The official Python documentation contains a
[good tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html).

```python
import logging
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from typing import List

_logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # get a logger for the current module


def solve_knapsack(
    weights: List[int],
    values: List[int],
    capacity: int,
    *,
    time_limit: int = 900,
    opt_tol: float = 0.01,
) -> List[int]:
    _logger.debug("Building the knapsack model")
    # initialize the model
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    n = len(weights)  # Number of items
    _logger.debug("Number of items: %d", n)
    if n > 0:
        _logger.debug(
            "Min/Mean/Max weight: %d/%.2f/%d",
            min(weights),
            sum(weights) / n,
            max(weights),
        )
        _logger.debug(
            "Min/Mean/Max value: %d/%.2f/%d", min(values), sum(values) / n, max(values)
        )
    # Decision variables for items
    x = [model.NewBoolVar(f"x_{i}") for i in range(n)]
    # Capacity constraint
    model.Add(sum(weights[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) <= capacity)
    # Objective function to maximize value
    model.Maximize(sum(values[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)))
    # Log the model
    _logger.debug("Model created with %d items", n)
    # Solve the model
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = time_limit  # Solver time limit
    solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = opt_tol  # Solver optimality tolerance
    _logger.debug(
        "Starting the solution process with time limit %d seconds", time_limit
    )
    status = solver.Solve(model)
    # Extract solution
    selected_items = (
        [i for i in range(n) if solver.Value(x[i])]
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]
        else []
    )
    _logger.debug("Selected items: %s", selected_items)
    return selected_items
```

We will not use logging in the following examples to save space, but you should
consider adding it to your code.

> [!TIP]
>
> A great hack you can do with the logging framework is that you can easily hook
> into your code and do analysis beyond the simple logging. You can simply write
> a handler that, e.g., waits for the tag `"Selected items: %s"` and then can
> directly access the selected items, as the actual object is passed to the
> handler (and not just the string). This can be very useful to gather
> statistics or to visualize the search process.

### Custom Data Classes for Instances, Configurations, and Solutions

Incorporating serializable data classes to manage instances, configurations, and
solutions significantly enhances the readability and maintainability of your
code. These classes also facilitate the documentation process, testing, and
ensure data consistency across larger projects where data exchange among
different components is necessary.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce data classes using
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/), a popular Python library that
supports data validation and settings management through Python type
annotations. The changes include:

- **Instance Class**: Defines the knapsack problem with attributes for weights,
  values, and capacity. It includes a validation method to ensure that the
  number of weights matches the number of values, thereby enhancing data
  integrity.
- **Configuration Class**: Manages solver settings such as time limits and
  optimality tolerance, allowing for easy adjustments and fine-tuning of the
  solver’s performance. Default values ensure backward compatibility,
  facilitating the seamless integration of older configurations with new
  parameters.
- **Solution Class**: Captures the outcome of the optimization process,
  including which items were selected, the objective value, and the upper bound
  of the solution. This class allows us to add additional information, instead
  of just returning the pure solution. It also allows us to later extend the
  attached information without breaking the API, by just making the new entries
  optional or providing a default value. For example, you may be interested in
  the solution time that was required to find the solution.

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model
from pydantic import BaseModel, PositiveInt, List, NonNegativeFloat


class KnapsackInstance(BaseModel):
    weights: List[PositiveInt]  # the weight of each item
    values: List[PositiveInt]  # the value of each item
    capacity: PositiveInt  # the capacity of the knapsack

    @model_validator(mode="after")
    def check_lengths(cls, v):
        if len(v.weights) != len(v.values):
            raise ValueError("Mismatch in number of weights and values.")
        return v


class KnapsackSolverConfig(BaseModel):
    time_limit: PositiveInt = 900  # Solver time limit in seconds
    opt_tol: NonNegativeFloat = 0.01  # Optimality tolerance (1% gap allowed)


class KnapsackSolution(BaseModel):
    selected_items: List[int]  # Indices of the selected items
    objective: int  # Objective value of the solution
    upper_bound: float  # Upper bound of the solution


def solve_knapsack(
    instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig
) -> KnapsackSolution:
    model = cp_model.CpModel()
    n = len(instance.weights)
    x = [model.NewBoolVar(f"x_{i}") for i in range(n)]
    model.Add(sum(instance.weights[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)) <= instance.capacity)
    model.Maximize(sum(instance.values[i] * x[i] for i in range(n)))
    solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
    solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = config.time_limit
    solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = config.opt_tol
    status = solver.Solve(model)
    if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[i for i in range(n) if solver.Value(x[i])],
            objective=solver.ObjectiveValue(),
            upper_bound=solver.BestObjectiveBound(),
        )
    return KnapsackSolution(selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=0)
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Structured Data Handling**: Defining explicit structures for each aspect of
  the problem ensures robust data handling and minimizes errors, facilitating
  easier integration and API exposition.
- **Easy Serialization**: Pydantic models support straightforward conversion to
  and from JSON, simplifying the storage and transmission of configurations and
  results.
- **Enhanced Testing and Documentation**: Clear data definitions make it easier
  to generate documentation and conduct tests that confirm the model and
  solver's behavior.
- **Backward Compatibility**: Default values in data classes enable seamless
  integration of older configurations with new software versions, accommodating
  new parameters without disrupting existing setups.

One challenge I often face is designing data classes to be as generic as
possible so that they can be used with multiple solvers and remain compatible
throughout various stages of the optimization process. For instance, a graph
might be represented as an edge list, an adjacency matrix, or an adjacency list,
each with its own pros and cons, complicating the decision of which format is
optimal for all stages. However, converting between different data class formats
is typically straightforward, often requiring only a few lines of code and
having a negligible impact compared to the optimization process itself.
Therefore, I recommend focusing on functionality with your current solver
without overcomplicating this aspect. There is little harm in having to call a
few convert functions because you created separate specialized data classes.

### Solver Class

In many real-world optimization scenarios, problems may require iterative
refinement of the model and solution. For instance, new constraints might only
become apparent after presenting an initial solution to a user or another
algorithm. In such cases, flexibility is crucial, making it beneficial to
encapsulate both the model and the solver within a single class. This setup
facilitates the dynamic addition of constraints and subsequent re-solving
without needing to rebuild the entire model.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce the `KnapsackSolver` class, which
encapsulates the entire setup and solving process of the knapsack problem:

```python
class KnapsackSolver:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig):
        self.instance = instance
        self.config = config
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()
        self.n = len(instance.weights)
        self.x = [self.model.NewBoolVar(f"x_{i}") for i in range(self.n)]
        self._build_model()
        self.solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

    def _add_constraints(self):
        used_weight = sum(
            weight * x_i for weight, x_i in zip(self.instance.weights, self.x)
        )
        self.model.Add(used_weight <= self.instance.capacity)

    def _add_objective(self):
        self.model.Maximize(
            sum(value * x_i for value, x_i in zip(self.instance.values, self.x))
        )

    def _build_model(self):
        self._add_constraints()
        self._add_objective()

    def solve(self) -> KnapsackSolution:
        self.solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = self.config.time_limit
        self.solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = self.config.opt_tol
        self.solver.parameters.log_search_progress = self.config.log_search_progress
        status = self.solver.Solve(self.model)
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
            return KnapsackSolution(
                selected_items=[
                    i for i in range(self.n) if self.solver.Value(self.x[i])
                ],
                objective=self.solver.ObjectiveValue(),
                upper_bound=self.solver.BestObjectiveBound(),
            )
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=float("inf")
        )

    def prohibit_combination(self, item_a: int, item_b: int):
        self.model.Add(self.x[item_a] + self.x[item_b] <= 1)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    instance = KnapsackInstance(weights=[1, 2, 3], values=[4, 5, 6], capacity=3)
    config = KnapsackSolverConfig(time_limit=10, opt_tol=0.01, log_search_progress=True)
    solver = KnapsackSolver(instance, config)
    solution = solver.solve()
    print(solution)
    solver.prohibit_combination(0, 1)
    solution = solver.solve()
    print(solution)
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Incremental Model Building and Re-solving**: The class structure not only
  facilitates incremental additions of constraints for iterative model
  modifications without starting from scratch but also supports multiple
  invocations of the `solve` method. This allows for iterative refinement of the
  solution by adjusting constraints or solver parameters such as time limits and
  optimality tolerance.
- **Direct Model and Solver Access**: Provides direct access to the model and
  solver, enhancing flexibility for advanced operations and debugging, a
  capability not exposed in the function-based approach.

### Variable Containers

Modularization is crucial in software engineering for maintaining and scaling
complex codebases. In the context of optimization models, modularizing by
separating variables from the core model logic is a strategic approach. This
separation facilitates easier management of variables and provides methods for
more structured interactions with them.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce the `_ItemVariables` class, which acts as
a container for the decision variables associated with the knapsack items. This
class not only creates these variables but also offers several utility methods
to interact with them, improving the clarity and maintainability of the code.

```python
from typing import Generator, Tuple


class _ItemVariables:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, model: cp_model.CpModel):
        self.instance = instance
        self.x = [model.NewBoolVar(f"x_{i}") for i in range(len(instance.weights))]

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.x[i]

    def extract_packed_items(self, solver: cp_model.CpSolver) -> List[int]:
        return [i for i, x_i in enumerate(self.x) if solver.Value(x_i)]

    def used_weight(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(weight * x_i for weight, x_i in zip(self.instance.weights, self.x))

    def packed_value(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(value * x_i for value, x_i in zip(self.instance.values, self.x))

    def iter_items(
        self,
        weight_lb: float = 0.0,
        weight_ub: float = float("inf"),
        value_lb: float = 0.0,
        value_ub: float = float("inf"),
    ) -> Generator[Tuple[int, cp_model.BoolVar], None, None]:
        for i, (weight, x_i) in enumerate(zip(self.instance.weights, self.x)):
            if (
                weight_lb <= weight <= weight_ub
                and value_lb <= self.instance.values[i] <= value_ub
            ):
                yield i, x_i


class KnapsackSolver:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig):
        self.instance = instance
        self.config = config
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()
        self._item_vars = _ItemVariables(instance, self.model)
        self._build_model()
        self.solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

    def _add_constraints(self):
        self.model.Add(self._item_vars.used_weight() <= self.instance.capacity)

    def _add_objective(self):
        self.model.Maximize(self._item_vars.packed_value())

    def _build_model(self):
        self._add_constraints()
        self._add_objective()

    def solve(self) -> KnapsackSolution:
        self.solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = self.config.time_limit
        self.solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = self.config.opt_tol
        self.solver.parameters.log_search_progress = self.config.log_search_progress
        status = self.solver.Solve(self.model)
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
            return KnapsackSolution(
                selected_items=self._item_vars.extract_packed_items(self.solver),
                objective=self.solver.ObjectiveValue(),
                upper_bound=self.solver.BestObjectiveBound(),
            )
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=float("inf")
        )

    def prohibit_combination(self, item_a: int, item_b: int):
        self.model.Add(self._item_vars[item_a] + self._item_vars[item_b] <= 1)
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Readability**: By encapsulating the item variables and their
  interactions within a dedicated class, the main solver class becomes more
  focused and easier to understand.
- **Improved Modularity**: The `_ItemVariables`-class allows to easily hand over
  the variables to a function that may create complex constraints, without
  creating a cyclic dependency. The model can now be split over multiple files
  without any issues.

### Submodels

As optimization models increase in complexity, it may be beneficial to divide
the overall model into smaller, more manageable submodels. These submodels can
encapsulate specific parts of the problem, communicating with the main model via
shared variables but hiding internal details like auxiliary variables.

For instance, piecewise linear functions can be modeled as submodels, as done
for `PiecewiseLinearConstraint` in
[./utils/piecewise_functions/piecewise_linear_function.py](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/utils/piecewise_functions/piecewise_linear_function.py).
Each submodel handles a piecewise linear function independently, interfacing
with the main model through shared `x` and `y` variables. By encapsulating the
logic for each piecewise function in a dedicated class, we standardize and reuse
the logic across multiple instances, enhancing modularity and maintainability.

```python
requirements_1 = (3, 5, 2)
requirements_2 = (2, 1, 3)

from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()
buy_1 = model.NewIntVar(0, 1_500, "buy_1")
buy_2 = model.NewIntVar(0, 1_500, "buy_2")
buy_3 = model.NewIntVar(0, 1_500, "buy_3")

produce_1 = model.NewIntVar(0, 300, "produce_1")
produce_2 = model.NewIntVar(0, 300, "produce_2")

model.Add(produce_1 * requirements_1[0] + produce_2 * requirements_2[0] <= buy_1)
model.Add(produce_1 * requirements_1[1] + produce_2 * requirements_2[1] <= buy_2)
model.Add(produce_1 * requirements_1[2] + produce_2 * requirements_2[2] <= buy_3)

# You can find this code it ./utils!
from piecewise_functions import PiecewiseLinearFunction, PiecewiseLinearConstraint

# Define the functions for the costs
costs_1 = [(0, 0), (1000, 400), (1500, 1300)]
costs_2 = [(0, 0), (300, 300), (700, 500), (1200, 600), (1500, 1100)]
costs_3 = [(0, 0), (200, 400), (500, 700), (1000, 900), (1500, 1500)]
# PiecewiseLinearFunction is a pydantic model and can be serialized easily!
f_costs_1 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_1], ys=[y for x, y in costs_1]
)
f_costs_2 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_2], ys=[y for x, y in costs_2]
)
f_costs_3 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(
    xs=[x for x, y in costs_3], ys=[y for x, y in costs_3]
)

# Define the functions for the gain
gain_1 = [(0, 0), (100, 800), (200, 1600), (300, 2_000)]
gain_2 = [(0, 0), (80, 1_000), (150, 1_300), (200, 1_400), (300, 1_500)]
f_gain_1 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[x for x, y in gain_1], ys=[y for x, y in gain_1])
f_gain_2 = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[x for x, y in gain_2], ys=[y for x, y in gain_2])

# Create y>=f(x) constraints for the costs
x_costs_1 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_1, f_costs_1, upper_bound=False)
x_costs_2 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_2, f_costs_2, upper_bound=False)
x_costs_3 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, buy_3, f_costs_3, upper_bound=False)

# Create y<=f(x) constraints for the gain
x_gain_1 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, produce_1, f_gain_1, upper_bound=True)
x_gain_2 = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, produce_2, f_gain_2, upper_bound=True)

# Maximize the gain minus the costs
model.Maximize(x_gain_1.y + x_gain_2.y - (x_costs_1.y + x_costs_2.y + x_costs_3.y))
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Testing**: Testing complex optimization models is often very difficult as
  the outputs are often sensitive to small changes in the model. Even if you
  have a good test case with predictable results, detected errors may be very
  difficult to track down. If you extracted elements into submodels, you can
  test these submodels independently, ensuring that they work correctly before
  integrating them into the main model.
  ```python
  def test_piecewise_linear_upper_bound_constraint():
      model = cp_model.CpModel()
      # Defining the input. Note that for some problems it may be
      # easier to fix variables to a specific value and then just
      # test feasibility.
      x = model.NewIntVar(0, 20, "x")
      f = PiecewiseLinearFunction(xs=[0, 10, 20], ys=[0, 10, 5])
      # Using the submodel
      c = PiecewiseLinearConstraint(model, x, f, upper_bound=True)
      model.Maximize(c.y)
      # Checking its behavior
      solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
      assert solver.Solve(model) == cp_model.OPTIMAL
      assert solver.Value(c.y) == 10
      assert solver.Value(x) == 10
  ```
- **Modularity**: Submodels allow for the encapsulation of complex logic into
  smaller, more manageable components, enhancing code organization and
  readability.
- **Reusability**: By defining submodels for common functions or constraints,
  you can reuse these components across multiple instances of the main model,
  promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy.
- **Abstraction**: Submodels abstract the internal details of specific
  functions, enabling users to interact with them at a higher level without
  needing to understand the underlying implementation.

### Lazy Variable Construction

In models with numerous auxiliary variables, often only a subset is actually
used by the constraints. You can now try to only create the variables that may
actually be needed later on, but this can require some complex code to ensure
that exactly the right variables are created. If the model is extended later on,
things can get even more complicated as you may not know which variables are
needed upfront. This is where lazy variable construction comes into play. Here,
we create variables only when they are accessed, ensuring that only necessary
variables are generated, reducing memory usage and computational overhead. While
this can be more expensive that just creating a vector with all variables, when
in the end most variables are needed anyway, but it can save a lot of memory and
computation time if only a small subset is actually used.

**Implemented Changes:** We introduce the new class `_CombiVariables` that
manages auxiliary variables indicating that a pair of items were packed,
allowing to give additional bonuses for packing certain items together.
Theoretically, there is a square number of possible combinations, but there will
probably only be a handful of them that are actually used. By creating the
variables only when they are accessed, we can reduce memory usage and
computational overhead.

```python
class _ItemVariables:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, model: cp_model.CpModel):
        self.instance = instance
        self.x = [model.NewBoolVar(f"x_{i}") for i in range(len(instance.weights))]

    def __getitem__(self, i):
        return self.x[i]

    def extract_packed_items(self, solver: cp_model.CpSolver) -> List[int]:
        return [i for i, x_i in enumerate(self.x) if solver.Value(x_i)]

    def used_weight(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(weight * x_i for weight, x_i in zip(self.instance.weights, self.x))

    def packed_value(self) -> cp_model.LinearExpr:
        return sum(value * x_i for value, x_i in zip(self.instance.values, self.x))

    def iter_items(
        self,
        weight_lb: float = 0.0,
        weight_ub: float = float("inf"),
        value_lb: float = 0.0,
        value_ub: float = float("inf"),
    ) -> Generator[Tuple[int, cp_model.BoolVar], None, None]:
        for i, (weight, x_i) in enumerate(zip(self.instance.weights, self.x)):
            if (
                weight_lb <= weight <= weight_ub
                and value_lb <= self.instance.values[i] <= value_ub
            ):
                yield i, x_i


class _CombiVariables:
    def __init__(
        self,
        instance: KnapsackInstance,
        model: cp_model.CpModel,
        item_vars: _ItemVariables,
    ):
        self.instance = instance
        self.model = model
        self.item_vars = item_vars
        self.bonus = {}

    def __getitem__(self, i, j):
        i, j = min(i, j), max(i, j)
        if (i, j) not in self.bonus:
            self.bonus[(i, j)] = self.model.NewBoolVar(f"bonus_{i}_{j}")
            self.model.Add(
                self.item_vars[i] + self.item_vars[j] >= 2 * self.bonus[(i, j)]
            )
        return self.bonus[(i, j)]


class KnapsackSolver:
    def __init__(self, instance: KnapsackInstance, config: KnapsackSolverConfig):
        self.instance = instance
        self.config = config
        self.model = cp_model.CpModel()
        self._item_vars = _ItemVariables(instance, self.model)
        self._bonus_vars = _CombiVariables(instance, self.model, self._item_vars)
        self._objective = self._item_vars.packed_value()  # Initial objective setup
        self.solver = cp_model.CpSolver()

    def solve(self) -> KnapsackSolution:
        self.model.Maximize(self._objective)
        self.solver.parameters.max_time_in_seconds = self.config.time_limit
        self.solver.parameters.relative_gap_limit = self.config.opt_tol
        self.solver.parameters.log_search_progress = self.config.log_search_progress
        status = self.solver.Solve(self.model)
        if status in [cp_model.OPTIMAL, cp_model.FEASIBLE]:
            return KnapsackSolution(
                selected_items=self._item_vars.extract_packed_items(self.solver),
                objective=self.solver.ObjectiveValue(),
                upper_bound=self.solver.BestObjectiveBound(),
            )
        return KnapsackSolution(
            selected_items=[], objective=0, upper_bound=float("inf")
        )

    def add_bonus(self, item_a: int, item_b: int, bonus: int):
        self._objective += bonus * self._bonus_vars[item_a, item_b]
```

**Key Benefits:**

- **Efficiency**: Lazy construction of variables ensures that only necessary
  variables are created, reducing memory usage and computational overhead.
- **Simplicity**: By just creating the variables when accessed, we do not need
  any logic to decide which variables are needed upfront, simplifying the model
  construction process.

### Embedding CP-SAT in an Application via multiprocessing

If you want to embed CP-SAT in your application for potentially long-running
optimization tasks, you can utilize callbacks to provide users with progress
updates and potentially interrupt the process early. However, one issue is that
the application can only react during the callback. Since the callback is not
always called frequently, this may lead to problematic delays, making it
unsuitable for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or application programming
interfaces (APIs).

An alternative is to let the solver run in a separate process and communicate
with it using a pipe. This approach allows the solver to be interrupted at any
time, enabling the application to react immediately. Python's multiprocessing
module provides reasonably simple ways to achieve this.
[This example](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main//examples/embedding_cpsat/)
showcases such an approach. However, for scaling this approach up, you will
actually have to build a task queues where the solver is run by workers. Using
multiprocessing can still be useful for the worker to remain responsive for stop
signals while the solver is running.

## How does it work?

![Cover Image How](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_7.webp)

CP-SAT is a versatile _portfolio_ solver, centered around a _Lazy Clause
Generation (LCG)_ based Constraint Programming Solver, although it encompasses a
broader spectrum of technologies.

In its role as a portfolio solver, CP-SAT concurrently executes a multitude of
diverse algorithms and strategies, each possessing unique strengths and
weaknesses. These elements operate largely independently but engage in
information exchange, sharing progress when better solutions emerge or tighter
bounds become available.

While this may initially appear as an inefficient approach due to potential
redundancy, it proves highly effective in practice. The rationale behind this
lies in the inherent challenge of predicting which algorithm is best suited to
solve a given problem (No Free Lunch Theorem). Thus, the pragmatic strategy
involves running various approaches in parallel, with the hope that one will
effectively address the problem at hand. Note that you can also specify which
algorithms should be used if you already know which strategies are promising or
futile.

In contrast, Branch and Cut-based Mixed Integer Programming solvers like Gurobi
implement a more efficient partitioning of the search space to reduce
redundancy. However, they specialize in a particular strategy, which may not
always be the optimal choice, although it frequently proves to be so.

CP-SAT employs Branch and Cut techniques, including linear relaxations and
cutting planes, as part of its toolkit. Models that can be efficiently addressed
by a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) solver are typically a good match for
CP-SAT as well. Nevertheless, CP-SAT's central focus is the implementation of
Lazy Clause Generation, harnessing SAT-solvers rather than relying primarily on
linear relaxations. As a result, CP-SAT may exhibit somewhat reduced performance
when confronted with MIP problems compared to dedicated MIP solvers. However, it
gains a distinct advantage when dealing with problems laden with intricate
logical constraints.

The concept behind Lazy Clause Generation involves the (incremental)
transformation of the problem into a SAT-formula, subsequently employing a
SAT-solver to seek a solution (or prove bounds by infeasibility). To mitigate
the impracticality of a straightforward conversion, Lazy Clause Generation
leverages an abundance of lazy variables and clauses.

Notably, the
[Cook-Levin Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cook%E2%80%93Levin_theorem)
attests that any problem within the realm of NP can be translated into a
SAT-formula. Optimization, in theory, could be achieved through a simple binary
search. However, this approach, while theoretically sound, lacks efficiency.
CP-SAT employs a more refined encoding scheme to tackle optimization problems
more effectively.

### What happens in CP-SAT on solve?

What actually happens when you execute `solver.Solve(model)`?

1. The model is read.
2. The model is verified.
3. Preprocessing (multiple iterations):
   1. Presolve (domain reduction) - Check
      [this video for SAT preprocessing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ez9ArInp8w4),
      [this video for MaxSAT preprocessing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLg4hbM8ooM),
      and
      [this paper for MIP presolving](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-zib/frontdoor/index/index/docId/6037).
   2. Expanding higher-level constraints to lower-level constraints. See also
      the analogous
      [FlatZinc and Flattening](https://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.5.5/en/flattening.html).
   3. Detection of equivalent variables and
      [affine relations](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/courses/m309-03a/a1/olafson/affine_fuctions.htm).
   4. Substitute these by canonical representations
   5. Probe some variables to detect if they are actually fixed or detect
      further equivalences.
4. Load the preprocessed model into the underlying solver and create the linear
   relaxations.
5. **Search for solutions and bounds with the different solvers until the lower
   and upper bound match or another termination criterion is reached (e.g., time
   limit)**
6. Transform solution back to original model.

This is taken from [this talk](https://youtu.be/lmy1ddn4cyw?t=434) and slightly
extended.

### The use of linear programming techniques

As already mentioned before, CP-SAT also utilizes the (dual) simplex algorithm
and linear relaxations. The linear relaxation is implemented as a propagator and
potentially executed at every node in the search tree but only at lowest
priority. A significant difference to the application of linear relaxations in
branch and bound algorithms is that only some pivot iterations are performed (to
make it faster). However, as there are likely much deeper search trees and the
warm-starts are utilized, the optimal linear relaxation may still be computed,
just deeper down the tree (note that for SAT-solving, the search tree is usually
traversed DFS). At root level, even cutting planes such as Gomory-Cuts are
applied to improve the linear relaxation.

The linear relaxation is used for detecting infeasibility (IPs can actually be
more powerful than simple SAT, at least in theory), finding better bounds for
the objective and variables, and also for making branching decisions (using the
linear relaxation's objective and the reduced costs).

The used Relaxation Induced Neighborhood Search RINS (LNS worker), a very
successful heuristic, of course also uses linear programming.

### Limitations of CP-SAT

While CP-SAT is undeniably a potent solver, it does possess certain limitations
when juxtaposed with alternative techniques:

1. While proficient, it may not match the speed of a dedicated SAT-solver when
   tasked with solving SAT-formulas, although its performance remains quite
   commendable.
2. Similarly, for classical MIP-problems, CP-SAT may not outpace dedicated
   MIP-solvers in terms of speed, although it still delivers respectable
   performance.
3. Unlike MIP/LP-solvers, CP-SAT lacks support for continuous variables, and the
   workarounds to incorporate them may not always be highly efficient. In cases
   where your problem predominantly features continuous variables and linear
   constraints, opting for an LP-solver is likely to yield significantly
   improved performance.
4. CP-SAT does not offer support for lazy constraints or iterative model
   building, a feature available in MIP/LP-solvers and select SAT-solvers.
   Consequently, the application of exponential-sized models, which are common
   and pivotal in Mixed Integer Programming, may be restricted.
5. CP-SAT is limited to the Simplex algorithm and does not feature interior
   point methods. This limitation prevents it from employing polynomial time
   algorithms for certain classes of quadratic constraints, such as Second Order
   Cone constraints. In contrast, solvers like Gurobi utilize the Barrier
   algorithm to efficiently tackle these constraints in polynomial time.

CP-SAT might also exhibit inefficiency when confronted with certain constraints,
such as modulo constraints. However, it's noteworthy that I am not aware of any
alternative solver capable of efficiently addressing these specific constraints.
At times, NP-hard problems inherently pose formidable challenges, leaving us
with no alternative but to seek more manageable modeling approaches instead of
looking for better solvers.

## Alternatives: CP-SAT's Place in the World of Optimization

![Cover Image World of Optimization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_8.webp)

When you begin exploring optimization, you will encounter a plethora of tools,
techniques, and communities. It can be overwhelming, as these groups, while
sharing many similarities, also differ significantly. They might use the same
terminology for different concepts or different terms for the same concepts,
adding to the confusion. Not too many experts can effectively navigate these
varied communities and techniques. Often, even specialists, including
professors, concentrate on a singular technique or community, remaining unaware
of potentially more efficient methods developed in other circles.

If you are interested in understanding the connections between different
optimization concepts, consider watching the talk
[Logic, Optimization, and Constraint Programming: A Fruitful Collaboration](https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/john-hooker-carnegie-mellon-university-2023-04-19)
by John Hooker. Please note that this is an academic presentation and assumes
some familiarity with theoretical computer science.

Let us now explore the various tools and techniques available, and see how they
compare to CP-SAT. Please note that this overview is high-level and not
exhaustive. If you have any significant additions, feel free to open an issue,
and I will consider including them.

- **Mixed Integer (Linear) Programming (MIP):** MIP is a highly effective method
  for solving a variety of optimization problems, particularly those involving
  networks like flow or tour problems. While MIP only supports linear
  constraints, making it less expressive than CP-SAT, it is often the best
  choice if your model is compatible with these constraints. CP-SAT incorporates
  techniques from MIP, but with limitations, including the absence of continuous
  variables and incremental modeling. Consequently, pure MIP-solvers, being more
  specialized, tend to offer greater efficiency for certain applications.
  Notable MIP-solvers include:
  - [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/): A commercial solver known for its
    state-of-the-art capabilities in MIP-solving. It offers free academic
    licenses, exceptional performance, user-friendliness, and comprehensive
    support through documentation and expert-led webinars. Gurobi is
    particularly impressive in handling complex, large-scale problems.
  - [SCIP](https://www.scipopt.org/): An open-source solver that provides a
    Python interface. Although not as efficient or user-friendly as Gurobi, SCIP
    allows extensive customization and is ideal for research and development,
    especially for experts needing to implement advanced decomposition
    techniques.
  - [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/): A newer solver licensed under MIT, presenting
    an interesting alternative to SCIP. It is possibly faster and features a
    more user-friendly interface, but is less versatile. For performance
    benchmarks, see [here](https://plato.asu.edu/ftp/milp.html).
- **Constraint Programming (CP):** Constraint Programming is a more general
  approach to optimization problems than MIP. As the name suggests, it focuses
  on constraints and solvers usually come with a lot of advanced constraints
  that can be used to describe your problem more naturally. A classical example
  is the `AllDifferent`-constraint, which is very hard to model in MIP, but
  would allow, e.g., to trivially model a Sudoku problem. Constraint Programming
  has been very successful for example in solving scheduling problems, where you
  have a lot of constraints that are hard to model with linear constraints. The
  internal techniques of CP-solvers are often more logic-based and less linear
  algebra-based than MIP-solvers. Popular CP-solvers are:
  - [OR-Tools' CP-SAT](https://github.com/google/or-tools/): Discussed in this
    primer, CP-SAT combines various optimization techniques, including those
    from MIP solvers, but its primary technique is Lazy Clause Generation. This
    approach translates problems into (Max-)SAT formulas for resolution.
  - [Choco](https://choco-solver.org/): A traditional CP solver developed in
    Java, licensed under the BSD 4-Clause. While it may not match CP-SAT in
    efficiency or modernity, Choco offers significant flexibility, including the
    option to integrate custom propagators.
- **SAT-Solvers:** If your problem is actually just to find a feasible solution
  for some boolean variables, you may want to use a SAT-solver. SAT-solvers are
  surprisingly efficient and can often handle problems with millions of
  variables. If you are clever, you can also do some optimization problems with
  SAT-solvers, as CP-SAT actually does. Most SAT-solvers support incremental
  modelling, and some support cardinality constraints. However, they are pretty
  low-level and CP-SAT actually can achieve similar performance for many
  problems. A popular library for SAT-solvers is:
  - [PySAT](https://pysathq.github.io/): PySAT is a Python library under MIT
    license that provides a nice interface to many SAT-solvers. It is very easy
    to use and allows you to switch between different solvers without changing
    your code. It is a good choice if you want to experiment with SAT-solvers.
  - There are many solvers popping up every year and many of them are open
    source. Check out the [SAT Competition](http://www.satcompetition.org/) to
    see the current state of the art. Most of the solvers are written in C or
    C++ and do not provide much documentation. However, as SAT-formulas are very
    simple and the solvers usually do not have complex dependencies, they can
    still be reasonably easy to use.
- **Satisfiability modulo theories (SMT):** SMT-solvers represent an advanced
  tier above traditional SAT-solvers. They aim to check the satisfiability of
  mathematical formulas by extending propositional logic with additional
  theories like linear arithmetic, bit-vectors, arrays, and quantifiers. For
  instance, an SMT-solver can determine if a formula is satisfiable under
  conditions where all variables are integers that meet specific linear
  constraints. Similar to the Lazy Clause Generation utilized by CP-SAT,
  SMT-solvers usually use a SAT-solver in the backend, extended by complex
  encodings and additional propagators to handle an extensive portfolio of
  expressions. These solvers are commonly used in automated theorem proving and
  system verification. A popular SMT-solver is:
  - [Z3](https://github.com/z3prover/z3): Developed by Microsoft and available
    under the MIT license, Z3 offers a robust Python interface and comprehensive
    documentation, making it accessible for a variety of applications.
- **Nonlinear Programming (NLP):** Many MIP-solvers can actually handle some
  nonlinear constraints, as people noticed that some techniques are actually
  more general than just for linear constraints, e.g., interior points methods
  can also solve second-order cone problems. However, you will notice serious
  performance downgrades. If your constraints and objectives get too complex,
  they may also no longer be a viable option. If you have smaller optimization
  problems of (nearly) any kind, you may want to look into:
  - [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html): SciPy is
    a Python library that offers a wide range of optimization algorithms. Do not
    expect it to get anywhere near the performance of a specialized solver, but
    it gives you a bunch of different options to solve a multitude of problems.
- **Modeling Languages:** Modeling languages provide a high-level, user-friendly
  interface for formulating optimization problems, focusing on the challenges of
  developing and maintaining models that accurately reflect real-world
  scenarios. These languages are solver-agnostic, allowing easy switching
  between different solvers - such as from the free SCIP solver to the
  commercial Gurobi - without modifying the underlying model. They also
  facilitate the use of diverse techniques, like transitioning between
  constraint programming and mixed integer programming. However, the trade-off
  is a potential loss of control and performance for the sake of generality and
  simplicity. Some of the most popular modeling languages include:
  - [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/): Very well-documented and free
    modelling language that seems to have a high reputation especially in the
    academic community. The
    [amazing course on constraint programming by Pierre Flener](https://user.it.uu.se/~pierref/courses/COCP/slides/)
    also uses MiniZinc. It supports many backends and there are the
    [MiniZinc Challenges](https://www.minizinc.org/challenge/), where CP-SAT won
    quite a lot of medals.
  - [AMPL](https://ampl.com/): AMPL is possibly the most popular modelling
    language. It has free and commercial solvers. There is not only extensive
    documentation, but even a book on how to use it.
  - [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/): This is a commercial system which supports
    many solvers and also has gotten a Python-interface. I actually know the
    guys from GAMS as they have a location in Braunschweig. They have a lot of
    experience in optimization, but I have never used their software myself.
  - [pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/): Pyomo is a Python library that allows you to
    model your optimization problem in Python and then let it solve by different
    solvers. It is not as high-level as AMPL or GAMS, but it is free and open
    source. It is also very flexible and allows you to use Python to model your
    problem, which is a huge advantage if you are already familiar with Python.
    It actually has support for CP-SAT and could be an option if you just want
    to have a quick solution.
  - [OR-Tools' MathOpt](https://developers.google.com/optimization/math_opt): A
    very new competitor and sibling of CP-SAT. It only supports a few solvers,
    but may be still interesting.
- **Specialized Algorithms:** For many optimization problems, there are
  specialized algorithms that can be much more efficient than general-purpose
  solvers. Examples are:
  - [Concorde](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/concorde.html): Concorde is a
    solver for the Traveling Salesman Problem that despite its age is still
    blazingly fast for many instances.
  - [OR-Tools' Routing Solver](https://developers.google.com/optimization/routing):
    OR-Tools also comes with a dedicated solver for routing problems.
  - [OR-Tools' Network Flows](https://developers.google.com/optimization/flow):
    OR-Tools also comes with a dedicated solver for network flow problems.
  - ...

As evident, there exists a diverse array of tools and techniques for solving
optimization problems. CP-SAT stands out as a versatile approach, particularly
well-suited for combinatorial optimization challenges. If you frequently
encounter these types of problems, becoming proficient with CP-SAT is highly
recommended. Its effectiveness across a broad spectrum of scenarios - excelling
in many - is remarkable for a tool that is both free and open-source.

## Benchmarking your Model

![Cover Image Benchmarking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_5.webp)

Benchmarking is an essential step if your model is not yet meeting the
performance standards of your application or if you are aiming for an academic
publication. This process involves analyzing your model's performance,
especially important if your model has adjustable parameters. Running your model
on a set of predefined instances (a benchmark) allows you to fine-tune these
parameters and compare results. Moreover, if alternative models exist,
benchmarking helps you ascertain whether your model truly outperforms these
competitors.

Designing an effective benchmark is a nuanced task that demands expertise. This
section aims to guide you in creating a reliable benchmark suitable for
publication purposes.

Given the breadth and complexity of benchmarking, our focus will be on the
basics, particularly through the lens of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
as previously discussed in the `AddCircuit` section. We refer to the different
model implementations as 'solvers', and we'll explore four specific types:

- A solver employing the `AddCircuit` approach.
- A solver based on the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation.
- A solver utilizing the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation with iterative
  addition of subtour constraints until a connected tour is achieved.
- A Gurobi-based solver applying the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation via
  Lazy Constraints, which are not supported by CP-SAT.

This example highlights common challenges in benchmarking and strategies to
address them. A key obstacle in solving NP-hard problems is the variability in
solver performance across different instances. For instance, a solver might
easily handle a large instance but struggle with a smaller one, and vice versa.
Consequently, it's crucial to ensure that your benchmark encompasses a
representative variety of instances. This diversity is vital for drawing
meaningful conclusions, such as the maximum size of a TSP instance that can be
solved or the most effective solver to use.

For a comprehensive exploration of benchmarking, I highly recommend Catherine C.
McGeoch's book,
["A Guide to Experimental Algorithmics"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/guide-to-experimental-algorithmics/CDB0CB718F6250E0806C909E1D3D1082),
which offers an in-depth discussion on this topic.

### Distinguishing Exploratory and Workhorse Studies in Benchmarking

Before diving into comprehensive benchmarking, it’s essential to conduct
preliminary investigations to assess your model’s capabilities and identify any
foundational issues. This phase, known as _exploratory studies_, is crucial for
establishing the basis for more detailed benchmarking, subsequently termed as
_workhorse studies_. These latter studies aim to provide reliable answers to
specific research questions and are often the core of academic publications.
It's important to explicitly differentiate between these two study types and
maintain their distinct purposes: exploratory studies for initial understanding
and flexibility, and workhorse studies for rigorous, reproducible research.

#### Exploratory Studies: Foundation Building

Exploratory studies serve as an introduction to both your model and the problem
it addresses. This phase is about gaining preliminary understanding and
insights.

- **Objective**: The goal here is to gather early insights rather than
  definitive conclusions. This phase is instrumental in identifying realistic
  problem sizes, potential challenges, and narrowing down hyperparameter search
  spaces.

For instance, in the `AddCircuit`-section, an exploratory study helped us
determine that our focus should be on instances with 100 to 200 nodes. If you
encounter fundamental issues with your model at this stage, it’s advisable to
address these before proceeding to workhorse studies.

> Occasionally, the primary performance bottleneck in your model may not be
> CP-SAT but rather the Python segment where the model is being generated. In
> these instances, identifying the most resource-intensive parts of your Python
> code is crucial. I have found the profiler
> [Scalene](https://github.com/plasma-umass/scalene) to be well-suited to
> investigate and pinpoint these bottlenecks.

#### Workhorse Studies: Conducting In-depth Evaluations

Workhorse studies follow the exploratory phase, characterized by more structured
and meticulous approaches. This stage is vital for a comprehensive evaluation of
your model and collecting substantive data for analysis.

- **Objective**: These studies are designed to answer specific research
  questions and provide meaningful insights. The approach here is more
  methodical, focusing on clearly defined research questions. The benchmarks
  designed should be well-structured and large enough to yield statistically
  significant results.

Remember, the aim is not to create a flawless benchmark right away but to evolve
it as concrete questions emerge and as your understanding of the model and
problem deepens. These studies, unlike exploratory ones, will be the focus of
your scientific publications, with exploratory studies only referenced for
justifying certain design decisions.

**Hint: Use the
[SIGPLAN Empirical Evaluation Checklist](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SIGPLAN/empirical-evaluation/master/checklist/checklist.pdf)
if your evaluation has to satisfy academic standards.**

### Designing a Robust Benchmark for Effective Studies

When undertaking both exploratory and workhorse studies, the creation of a
well-designed benchmark is a critical step. This benchmark is the basis upon
which you'll test and evaluate your solvers. For exploratory studies, your
benchmark can start simple and progressively evolve. However, when it comes to
workhorse studies, the design of your benchmark demands meticulous attention to
ensure comprehensiveness and reliability.

While exploratory studies also benefit from a thoughtfully designed benchmark—as
it accelerates insight acquisition—the primary emphasis at this stage is to have
a functioning benchmark in place. This initial benchmark acts as a springboard,
providing a foundation for deeper, more detailed analysis in the subsequent
workhorse studies. The key is to balance the immediacy of starting with a
benchmark against the long-term goal of refining it for more rigorous
evaluations.

Ideally, a robust benchmark would consist of a large set of real-world
instances, closely reflecting the actual performance of your solver. Real-world
instances, however, are often limited in quantity and may not provide enough
data for a statistically significant benchmark. In such cases, it's advisable to
explore existing benchmarks from literature, like the
[TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) for TSP.
Leveraging established benchmarks allows for comparison with prior studies, but
be cautious about their quality, as not all are equally well-constructed. For
example, TSPLIB's limitations in terms of instance size variation and
heterogeneity can hinder result aggregation.

Therefore, creating custom instances might be necessary. When doing so, aim for
enough instances per size category to establish reliable and statistically
significant data points. For instance, generating 10 instances for each size
category (e.g., 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500) can
provide a solid basis for analysis. This approach, though modest in scale,
suffices to illustrate the benchmarking process.

Exercise caution with random instance generators, as they may not accurately
represent real-world scenarios. For example, randomly generated TSP instances
might lack collinear points common in real-world situations, like houses aligned
on straight roads, or they might not replicate real-world clustering patterns.
To better mimic reality, incorporate real-world data or use diverse generation
methods to ensure a broader variety of instances. For the TSP, we could for
example also have sampled from the larger TSPLIB instances.

Consider conducting your evaluation using two distinct benchmarks, especially
when dealing with different data types. For instance, you might have one
benchmark derived from real-world data which, although highly relevant, is too
limited in size to provide robust statistical insights. Simultaneously, you
could use a second benchmark based on a larger set of random instances, better
suited for detailed statistical analysis. This dual-benchmark approach allows
you to demonstrate the consistency and reliability of your results, ensuring
they are not merely artifacts of a particular dataset's characteristics. It's a
strategy that adds depth to your evaluation, showcasing the robustness of your
findings across varied data sources. We will use this approach below, generating
robust plots from random instances, but also comparing them to real-world
instances. Mixing the two benchmarks would not be advisable, as the random
instances would dominate the results.

Lastly, always separate the creation of your benchmark from the execution of
experiments. Create and save instances in a separate process to minimize errors.
The goal is to make your evaluation as error-proof as possible, avoiding the
frustration and wasted effort of basing decisions on flawed data. Be
particularly cautious with pseudo-random number generators; while theoretically
deterministic, their use can inadvertently lead to irreproducible results.
Sharing benchmarks is also more straightforward when you can distribute the
instances themselves, rather than the code used to generate them.

### Efficiently Managing Your Benchmarks

Managing benchmark data can become complex, especially with multiple experiments
and research questions. Here are some strategies to keep things organized:

- **Folder Structure**: Maintain a clear folder structure for your experiments,
  with a top-level `evaluations` folder and descriptive subfolders for each
  experiment. For our experiment we have the following structure:
  ```
  evaluations
  ├── tsp
  │   ├── 2023-11-18_random_euclidean
  │   │   ├── PRIVATE_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... all data for debugging
  │   │   ├── PUBLIC_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... selected data to share
  │   │   ├── README.md: Provide a short description of the experiment
  │   │   ├── 00_generate_instances.py
  │   │   ├── 01_run_experiments.py
  │   │   ├── ....
  │   ├── 2023-11-18_tsplib
  │   │   ├── PRIVATE_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... all data for debugging
  │   │   ├── PUBLIC_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... selected data to share
  │   │   ├── README.md: Provide a short description of the experiment
  │   │   ├── 01_run_experiments.py
  │   │   ├── ....
  ```
- **Redundancy and Documentation**: While some redundancy is acceptable,
  comprehensive documentation of each experiment is crucial for future
  reference.
- **Simplified Results**: Keep a streamlined version of your results for easy
  access, especially for plotting and sharing.
- **Data Storage**: Save all your data, even if it seems insignificant at the
  time. This ensures you have a comprehensive dataset for later analysis or
  unexpected inquiries. Because this can become a lot of data, it's advisable to
  have two folders: One with all data and one with a selection of data that you
  want to share.
- **Experiment Flexibility**: Design experiments to be interruptible and
  extendable, allowing for easy resumption or modification. This is especially
  important for exploratory studies, where you may need to make frequent
  adjustments. However, if your workhorse study takes a long time to run, you do
  not want to repeat it from scratch if you want to add a further solver.
- **Utilizing Technology**: Employ tools like slurm for efficient distribution
  of experiments across computing clusters, saving time and resources. The
  faster you have your results, the faster you can act on them.

Due to a lack of tools that exactly fitted my needs I developed
[AlgBench](https://github.com/d-krupke/AlgBench) to manage the results, and
[Slurminade](https://github.com/d-krupke/slurminade) to easily distribute the
experiments on a cluster via a simple decorator. However, there may be better
tools out there, now, especially from the Machine Learning community. Drop me a
quick mail if you have found some tools you are happy with, and I will take a
look myself.

### Analyzing the results

Let us now come to the actual analysis of the results. We will focus on the
following questions:

- Up to which size can we solve TSP instances with the different solvers?
- Which solver is the fastest?
- How does the performance change if we increase the optimality tolerance?

> **Our Benchmarks:** We executed the four solvers with a time limit of 90s and
> the optimality tolerances [0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%] on a random benchmark set
> and a TSPLIB benchmark set. The random benchmark set consists of 10 instances
> for each number of nodes [25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, > 250, 300, 350, 400, > >
>
> > 450, 500]. The weights were chosen based on randomly embedding the nodes
> > into a 2D plane and using the Euclidean distances. The TSPLIB benchmark
> > consists of all euclidean instances with less than 500 nodes. It is critical
> > to have a time limit, as otherwise, the benchmarks would take forever. You
> > can find all find the whole experiment
> > [here](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/).

Let us first look at the results of the random benchmark, as they are easier to
interpret. We will then compare them to the TSPLIB benchmark.

#### Random Instances

A common, yet simplistic method to assess a model's performance involves
plotting its runtime against the size of the instances it processes. However,
this approach can often lead to inaccurate interpretations, particularly because
time-limited cutoffs can disproportionately affect the results. Instead of the
expected exponential curves, you will get skewed sigmoidal curves. Consequently,
such plots might not provide a clear understanding of the instance sizes your
model is capable of handling efficiently.

|                                                                             ![Runtime](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/runtime.png)                                                                              |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| The runtimes are sigmoidal instead of exponential because the time limit skews the results. The runtime can frequently exceed the time limit, because of expensive model building, etc. Thus, a pure runtime plot says surprisingly little (or is misleading) and can usually be discarded. |

To gain a more accurate insight into the capacities of your model, consider
plotting the proportion of instances of a certain size that your model
successfully solves. This method requires a well-structured benchmark to yield
meaningful statistics for each data point. Without this structure, the resulting
curve may appear erratic, making it challenging to draw dependable conclusions.

| ![Solved over size](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size.png) |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                            For each x-value: What are the chances (y-values) that a model of this size (x) can be solved?                            |

Furthermore, if the pursuit is not limited to optimal solutions but extends to
encompass solutions of acceptable quality, the analysis can be expanded. One can
plot the number of instances that the model solves within a defined optimality
tolerance, as demonstrated in the subsequent figure:

| ![Solved over size with optimality tolerance](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size_opt_tol.png) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                              For each x-value: What are the chances (y-values) that a model of this size (x) can be solved to what quality (line style)?                               |

For a comparative analysis across various models against an arbitrary benchmark,
cactus plots emerge as a potent tool. These plots illustrate the number of
instances solved over time, providing a clear depiction of a model's efficiency.
For example, a coordinate of $x=10, y=20$ on such a plot signifies that 20
instances were solved within a span of 10 seconds each. It is important to note,
however, that these plots do not facilitate predictions for any specific
instance unless the benchmark set is thoroughly familiar. They do allow for an
estimation of which model is quicker for simpler instances and which can handle
more challenging instances within a reasonable timeframe. The question of what
exactly is a simple or challenging instance, however, is better answered by the
previous plots.

Cactus plots are notably prevalent in the evaluation of SAT-solvers, where
instance size is a poor indicator of difficulty. A more detailed discussion on
this subject can be found in the referenced academic paper:
[Benchmarking Solvers, SAT-style by Brain, Davenport, and Griggio](http://www.sc-square.org/CSA/workshop2-papers/RP3-FinalVersion.pdf)

| ![Cactus Plot 1](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot.png) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                  For each x-value: How many (y) of the benchmark instances could have been solved with this time limit (x)?                  |

Additionally, the analysis can be refined to account for different quality
tolerances. This requires either multiple experimental runs or tracking the
progression of the lower and upper bounds within the solver. In the context of
CP-SAT, for instance, this tracking can be implemented via the Solution
Callback, although its activation is may depend on updates to the objective
rather than the bounds.

| ![Cactus Plot 1](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot_opt_tol.png) |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    For each x-value: How many (y) of the benchmark instances could have been solved to a specific quality (line style) with this time limit (x)?     |

Instead of plotting the number of solved instances, one can also plot the number
of unsolved instances over time. This can be easier to read and additionally
indicates the number of instances in the benchmark. However, I personally do not
have a preference for one or the other, and would recommend using the one that
is more intuitive to read for you.

#### TSPLIB

Our second benchmark for the Traveling Salesman Problem leverages the TSPLIB, a
set of instances based on real-world data. This will introduce two challenges:

1. The difficulty in aggregating benchmark data due to its limited size and
   heterogeneous nature.
2. Notable disparities in results, arising from the differing characteristics of
   random and real-world instances.

The irregularity in instance sizes makes traditional plotting methods, like
plotting the number of solved instances over time, less effective. While data
smoothing methods, such as rolling averages, are available, they too have their
limitations.

| ![Variation in Data](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_tsplib/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size.png) |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|       Such a plot may prove inefficient when dealing with high variability, particularly when some data points are underrepresented.        |

In contrast, the cactus plot still provides a clear and comprehensive
perspective of various model performances. An interesting observation we can
clearly see in it, is the diminished capability of the "Iterative Dantzig" model
in solving instances, and a closer performance alignment between the
`AddCircuit` and Gurobi models.

| ![Effective Cactus Plot](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_tsplib/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot_opt_tol.png) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                Cactus plots maintain clarity and relevance, and show a performance differences between TSPLib and random instances.                |

However, since cactus plots do not offer insights into individual instances,
it's beneficial to complement them with a detailed table of results for the
specific model you are focusing on. This approach ensures a more nuanced
understanding of model performance across varied instances. The following table
provides the results for the `AddCircuit`-model.

A last option is to split the y-axis into the part where the solving time is
still within the time limit, and the part where it is not and the optimality gap
becomes relevant. Such a plot has some benefits but can also be difficult to
scale or aggregate.

This should highlight that often you need a combination of different benchmarks
and plots to get a good understanding of the performance of your model.

### Conclusion

Benchmarking solvers for NP-hard problems is not as straightforward as it might
seem at first. There are many pitfalls and often there is no perfect solution.
On the example of the TSP, we have seen how we can still get some useful results
and nice plots on which we can base our decisions.

## Using CP-SAT for Bigger Problems with Large Neighborhood Search

![Cover Image LNS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/main/images/logo_6.webp)

CP-SAT is great at solving small and medium-sized problems. But what if you have
a really big problem on your hands? One option might be to use a special kind of
algorithm known as a "meta-heuristic", like a
[genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm). But these
can be hard to set up and might not even give you good results.

Sometimes you will see new algorithms with cool-sounding names in scientific
papers. While tempting, these are often just small twists on older methods and
might leave out key details that make them work. If you are interested, there's
a discussion about this issue in a paper by Sörensen, called
["Metaheuristics – The Metaphor Exposed"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/itor.12001/).

The good news? You do not have to implement an algorithm that simulates the
mating behavior of forest frogs to solve your problem. If you already know how
to use CP-SAT, you can stick with it to solve big problems without adding
unnecessary complications. Even better? This technique, called Large
Neighborhood Search, often outperforms all other approaches.

### What Sets Large Neighborhood Search Apart?

Many traditional methods generate several "neighbor" options around an existing
solution and pick the best one. However, making each neighbor solution takes
time, limiting how many you can examine.

Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) offers a more efficient approach. Instead of
generating neighbors one by one, LNS formulates a "mini-problem" that modifies
parts of the current solution. This often involves randomly selecting some
variables, resetting them, and using CP-SAT (or a similar tool) to find the
optimal new values within the context of the remaining solution. This method,
known as "destroy and repair," allows for a broader exploration of neighbor
solutions without constructing each one individually.

Moreover, LNS can easily be mixed with other methods like genetic algorithms. If
you are already using a genetic algorithm, you could supercharge it by applying
CP-SAT to find the best possible crossover of two or more existing solutions. It
is like genetic engineering, but without any ethical worries!

When looking into the logs of CP-SAT, you may notice that it uses LNS itself to
find better solutions.

```
8 incomplete subsolvers: [feasibility_pump, graph_arc_lns, graph_cst_lns, graph_dec_lns, graph_var_lns, rins/rens, rnd_cst_lns, rnd_var_lns]
```

Why does it not suffice to just run CP-SAT if it already solves the problem with
LNS? The reason is that CP-SAT has to be relatively problem-agnostic. It has no
way of knowing the structure of your problem and thus cannot use this
information to improve the search. You on the other hand know a lot about your
problem and can use this knowledge to implement a more efficient version.

**Literature:**

- General Paper on LNS-variants:
  [Pisinger and Ropke - 2010](https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/5293785/Pisinger.pdf)
- A generic variant (RINS), that is also used by CP-SAT:
  [Danna et al. 2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-004-0518-7)

We will now look into some examples to see this approach in action.

#### Example 1: Knapsack

You are given a knapsack that can carry a certain weight limit $C$, and you have
various items $I$ you can put into it. Each item $i\in I$ has a weight $w_i$ and
a value $v_i$. The goal is to pick items to maximize the total value while
staying within the weight limit.

```math
\max \sum_{i \in I} v_i x_i
```

```math
\text{s.t.} \sum_{i \in I} w_i x_i \leq C
```

```math
x_i \in \\{0,1\\}
```

This is one of the simplest NP-hard problems and can be solved with a dynamic
programming approach in pseudo-polynomial time. CP-SAT is also able to solve
many large instances of this problem in an instant. However, its simple
structure makes it a good example to demonstrate the use of Large Neighborhood
Search, even if the algorithm will not be of much use for this problem.

A simple idea for the LNS is to delete some elements from the current solution,
compute the remaining capacity after deletion, select some additional items from
the remaining items, and try to find the optimal solution to fill the remaining
capacity with the deleted items and the newly selected items. Repeat this until
you are happy with the solution quality. The number of items you delete and
select can be fixed such that the problem can be easily solved by CP-SAT. You
can find a full implementation under
[examples/lns_knapsack.ipynb](examples/lns_knapsack.ipynb).

Let us look only on an example here:

Instance: $C=151$,
$I=I_{0}(w=12, v=37),I_{1}(w=16, v=49),I_{2}(w=20, v=53),I_{3}(w=11, v=14),I_{4}(w=19, v=42),$

$\quad I_{15}(w=13, v=54),I_{16}(w=12, v=33),I_{17}(w=12, v=38),I_{18}(w=14, v=43),I_{19}(w=15, v=28),$
$\quad I_{20}(w=11, v=47),I_{21}(w=10, v=31),I_{22}(w=20, v=97),I_{23}(w=10, v=35),I_{24}(w=19, v=56),$
$\quad I_{25}(w=11, v=33),I_{26}(w=12, v=38),I_{27}(w=15, v=45),I_{28}(w=17, v=58),I_{29}(w=11, v=48),$
$\quad I_{30}(w=15, v=32),I_{31}(w=17, v=67),I_{32}(w=15, v=43),I_{33}(w=16, v=41),I_{34}(w=18, v=42),$
$\quad I_{35}(w=14, v=44),I_{36}(w=20, v=45),I_{37}(w=13, v=50),I_{38}(w=17, v=57),I_{39}(w=17, v=33),$
$\quad I_{40}(w=17, v=49),I_{41}(w=12, v=21),I_{42}(w=14, v=37),I_{43}(w=20, v=74),I_{44}(w=14, v=55),$
$\quad I_{45}(w=10, v=25),I_{46}(w=16, v=26),I_{47}(w=10, v=37),I_{48}(w=18, v=63),I_{49}(w=16, v=39),$
$\quad I_{50}(w=16, v=57),I_{51}(w=16, v=47),I_{52}(w=10, v=43),I_{53}(w=12, v=30),I_{54}(w=12, v=40),$
$\quad I_{55}(w=19, v=48),I_{56}(w=12, v=39),I_{57}(w=14, v=43),I_{58}(w=17, v=35),I_{59}(w=19, v=51),$
$\quad I_{60}(w=16, v=48),I_{61}(w=19, v=72),I_{62}(w=16, v=45),I_{63}(w=19, v=88),I_{64}(w=15, v=20),$
$\quad I_{65}(w=17, v=49),I_{66}(w=14, v=40),I_{67}(w=14, v=27),I_{68}(w=19, v=51),I_{69}(w=10, v=37),$
$\quad I_{70}(w=15, v=42),I_{71}(w=13, v=29),I_{72}(w=20, v=87),I_{73}(w=13, v=28),I_{74}(w=15, v=38),$
$\quad I_{75}(w=19, v=77),I_{76}(w=13, v=35),I_{77}(w=17, v=55),I_{78}(w=13, v=39),I_{79}(w=10, v=26),$
$\quad I_{80}(w=15, v=32),I_{81}(w=12, v=40),I_{82}(w=11, v=21),I_{83}(w=18, v=82),I_{84}(w=13, v=41),$
$\quad I_{85}(w=12, v=27),I_{86}(w=15, v=35),I_{87}(w=18, v=48),I_{88}(w=15, v=64),I_{89}(w=19, v=62),$
$\quad I_{90}(w=20, v=64),I_{91}(w=13, v=45),I_{92}(w=19, v=64),I_{93}(w=18, v=83),I_{94}(w=11, v=38),$
$\quad I_{95}(w=10, v=30),I_{96}(w=18, v=65),I_{97}(w=19, v=56),I_{98}(w=12, v=41),I_{99}(w=17, v=36)$

Initial solution of value 442:
$\\{I_{0}, I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}, I_{4}, I_{5}, I_{6}, I_{7}, I_{8}, I_{9}\\}$

We will now repeatedly delete 5 items from the current solution and try to fill
the newly gained capacity with an optimal solution built from the deleted items
and 10 additional items. Note that this approach essentially considers
$2^{5+10}=32768$ neighbored solutions in each iteration. However, we could
easily scale it up to consider $2^{100+900}\sim 10^{300}$ neighbored solutions
in each iteration thanks to the implicit representation of the neighbored
solutions and CP-SAT ability to prune large parts of the search space.

**Round 1 of LNS algorithm:**

- Deleting the following 5 items from the solution:
  $\\{I_{0}, I_{7}, I_{8}, I_{9}, I_{6}\\}$
- Repairing solution by considering the following subproblem:
  - Subproblem: $C=72$,
    $I=\\{I_{6},I_{9},I_{86},I_{13},I_{47},I_{73},I_{0},I_{8},I_{7},I_{38},I_{57},I_{11},I_{60},I_{14}\\}$
- Computed the following solution of value 244 for the subproblem:
  $\\{I_{8}, I_{9}, I_{13}, I_{38}, I_{47}\\}$
- Combining
  $\\{I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}, I_{4}, I_{5}\\}\cup \\{I_{8}, I_{9}, I_{13}, I_{38}, I_{47}\\}$
- New solution of value 455:
  $\\{I_{1}, I_{2}, I_{3}, I_{4}, I_{5}, I_{8}, I_{9}, I_{13}, I_{38}, I_{47}\\}$

#### Example 2: Different Neighborhoods for the Traveling Salesman Problem

Simply removing a portion of the solution and then trying to fix it is not the
most effective approach. In this section, we will explore various neighborhoods
for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The geometry of TSP not only permits
advantageous neighborhoods but also offers visually appealing representations.
When you have several neighborhood strategies, they can be dynamically
integrated using an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS).

The image illustrates an optimization process for a tour that needs to traverse
the green areas, factoring in turn costs, within an embedded graph (mesh). The
optimization involves choosing specific regions (highlighted in red) and
calculating the optimal tour within them. As iterations progress, the initial
tour generally improves, although some iterations may not yield any enhancement.
Regions in red are selected due to the high cost of the tour within them. Once
optimized, the center of that region is added to a tabu list, preventing it from
being chosen again.

| Large Neighbordhood Search for Coverage Path Planning by repeatedly selecting a geometric region (red) and optimizing the tour within it. The red parts of the tour highlight the changes in the iteration. Read from left to right, and from up to down. |

How can you determine the appropriate size of a region to select? You have two
main options: conduct preliminary experiments or adjust the size adaptively
during the search. Simply allocate a time limit for each iteration. If the
solver does not optimize within that timeframe, decrease the region size.
Conversely, if it does, increase the size. Utilizing exponential factors will
help the size swiftly converge to its optimal dimension. However, it's essential
to note that this method assumes subproblems are of comparable difficulty and
may necessitate additional conditions.

For the Euclidean TSP, as opposed to a mesh, optimizing regions is not
straightforward. Multiple effective strategies exist, such as employing a
segment from the previous tour rather than a geometric region. By implementing
various neighborhoods and evaluating their success rates, you can allocate a
higher selection probability to the top-performing ones. This approach is
demonstrated in an animation crafted by two of my students, Gabriel Gehrke and
Laurenz Illner. They incorporated four distinct neighborhoods and utilized ALNS
to dynamically select the most effective one.

It uses four different neighborhood strategies which are selected randomly with a probability based on their success rate in previous iterations. If you check the logs of the latest (v9.8) version of CP-SAT, it also rates the performance of its LNS-strategies and uses the best performing strategies more often (UCB1-algorithm). |

#### Multi-Armed Bandit: Exploration vs. Exploitation

Having multiple strategies for each iteration of your LNS available is great,
but how do you decide which one to use? You could just pick one randomly, but
this is not very efficient as it is unlikely to select the best one. You could
also use the strategy that worked best in the past, but maybe there is a better
one you have not tried yet. This is the so-called exploration vs. exploitation
dilemma. You want to exploit the strategies that worked well in the past, but
you also want to explore new strategies to find even better ones. Luckily, this
problem has been studied extensively as the
[Multi-Armed Bandit Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit)
for decades, and there are many good solutions. One of the most popular ones is
the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1) algorithm, which is also used by CP-SAT. In
the following, you can see the a LNS-statistic of the CP-SATs strategies.

```

         'rnd_var_lns':          6/66     52%        0.36       0.10
    'routing_path_lns':         41/65     48%        0.10       0.10
  'routing_random_lns':         24/65     52%        0.26       0.10
```

We will not dig into the details of the algorithm here, but if you are
interested, you can find many good resources online. I just wanted to make you
aware of the exploration vs. exploitation dilemma and that many smart people
have already thought about it.

Benchmarking is an essential step if your model is not yet meeting the
performance standards of your application or if you are aiming for an academic
publication. This process involves analyzing your model's performance,
especially important if your model has adjustable parameters. Running your model
on a set of predefined instances (a benchmark) allows you to fine-tune these
parameters and compare results. Moreover, if alternative models exist,
benchmarking helps you ascertain whether your model truly outperforms these
competitors.

Designing an effective benchmark is a nuanced task that demands expertise. This
section aims to guide you in creating a reliable benchmark suitable for
publication purposes.

Given the breadth and complexity of benchmarking, our focus will be on the
basics, particularly through the lens of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
as previously discussed in the `add_circuit` section. We refer to the different
model implementations as 'solvers', and we'll explore four specific types:

- A solver employing the `add_circuit` approach.
- A solver based on the Miller-Tucker-Zemlin formulation.
- A solver utilizing the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation with iterative
  addition of subtour constraints until a connected tour is achieved.
- A Gurobi-based solver applying the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson formulation via
  Lazy Constraints, which are not supported by CP-SAT.

This example highlights common challenges in benchmarking and strategies to
address them. A key obstacle in solving NP-hard problems is the variability in
solver performance across different instances. For instance, a solver might
easily handle a large instance but struggle with a smaller one, and vice versa.
Consequently, it is crucial to ensure that your benchmark encompasses a
representative variety of instances. This diversity is vital for drawing
meaningful conclusions, such as the maximum size of a TSP instance that can be
solved or the most effective solver to use.

For a comprehensive exploration of benchmarking, I highly recommend Catherine C.
McGeoch's book,
["A Guide to Experimental Algorithmics"](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/guide-to-experimental-algorithmics/CDB0CB718F6250E0806C909E1D3D1082),
which offers an in-depth discussion on this topic.

### Distinguishing Exploratory and Workhorse Studies in Benchmarking

Before diving into comprehensive benchmarking, it is essential to conduct
preliminary investigations to assess your model’s capabilities and identify any
foundational issues. This phase, known as _exploratory studies_, is crucial for
establishing the basis for more detailed benchmarking, subsequently termed as
_workhorse studies_. These latter studies aim to provide reliable answers to
specific research questions and are often the core of academic publications. It
is important to explicitly differentiate between these two study types and
maintain their distinct purposes: exploratory studies for initial understanding
and flexibility, and workhorse studies for rigorous, reproducible research.

#### Exploratory Studies: Foundation Building

Exploratory studies serve as an introduction to both your model and the problem
it addresses. This phase is about gaining preliminary understanding and
insights.

- **Objective**: The goal here is to gather early insights rather than
  definitive conclusions. This phase is instrumental in identifying realistic
  problem sizes, potential challenges, and narrowing down hyperparameter search
  spaces.

For instance, in the `add_circuit`-section, an exploratory study helped us
determine that our focus should be on instances with 100 to 200 nodes. If you
encounter fundamental issues with your model at this stage, it’s advisable to
address these before proceeding to workhorse studies.

> investigate and pinpoint these bottlenecks.

#### Workhorse Studies: Conducting In-depth Evaluations

Workhorse studies follow the exploratory phase, characterized by more structured
and meticulous approaches. This stage is vital for a comprehensive evaluation of
your model and collecting substantive data for analysis.

- **Objective**: These studies are designed to answer specific research
  questions and provide meaningful insights. The approach here is more
  methodical, focusing on clearly defined research questions. The benchmarks
  designed should be well-structured and large enough to yield statistically
  significant results.

Remember, the aim is not to create a flawless benchmark right away but to evolve
it as concrete questions emerge and as your understanding of the model and
problem deepens. These studies, unlike exploratory ones, will be the focus of
your scientific publications, with exploratory studies only referenced for
justifying certain design decisions.

### Designing a Robust Benchmark for Effective Studies

When undertaking both exploratory and workhorse studies, the creation of a
well-designed benchmark is a critical step. This benchmark is the basis upon
which you'll test and evaluate your solvers. For exploratory studies, your
benchmark can start simple and progressively evolve. However, when it comes to
workhorse studies, the design of your benchmark demands meticulous attention to
ensure comprehensiveness and reliability.

While exploratory studies also benefit from a thoughtfully designed benchmark—as
it accelerates insight acquisition—the primary emphasis at this stage is to have
a functioning benchmark in place. This initial benchmark acts as a springboard,
providing a foundation for deeper, more detailed analysis in the subsequent
workhorse studies. The key is to balance the immediacy of starting with a
benchmark against the long-term goal of refining it for more rigorous
evaluations.

Ideally, a robust benchmark would consist of a large set of real-world
instances, closely reflecting the actual performance of your solver. Real-world
instances, however, are often limited in quantity and may not provide enough
data for a statistically significant benchmark. In such cases, it is advisable
to explore existing benchmarks from literature, like the
[TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) for TSP.
Leveraging established benchmarks allows for comparison with prior studies, but
be cautious about their quality, as not all are equally well-constructed. For
example, TSPLIB's limitations in terms of instance size variation and
heterogeneity can hinder result aggregation.

Therefore, creating custom instances might be necessary. When doing so, aim for
enough instances per size category to establish reliable and statistically
significant data points. For instance, generating 10 instances for each size
category (e.g., 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500) can
provide a solid basis for analysis. This approach, though modest in scale,
suffices to illustrate the benchmarking process.

Exercise caution with random instance generators, as they may not accurately
represent real-world scenarios. For example, randomly generated TSP instances
might lack collinear points common in real-world situations, like houses aligned
on straight roads, or they might not replicate real-world clustering patterns.
To better mimic reality, incorporate real-world data or use diverse generation
methods to ensure a broader variety of instances. For the TSP, we could for
example also have sampled from the larger TSPLIB instances.

Consider conducting your evaluation using two distinct benchmarks, especially
when dealing with different data types. For instance, you might have one
benchmark derived from real-world data which, although highly relevant, is too
limited in size to provide robust statistical insights. Simultaneously, you
could use a second benchmark based on a larger set of random instances, better
suited for detailed statistical analysis. This dual-benchmark approach allows
you to demonstrate the consistency and reliability of your results, ensuring
they are not merely artifacts of a particular dataset's characteristics. It's a
strategy that adds depth to your evaluation, showcasing the robustness of your
findings across varied data sources. We will use this approach below, generating
robust plots from random instances, but also comparing them to real-world
instances. Mixing the two benchmarks would not be advisable, as the random
instances would dominate the results.

Lastly, always separate the creation of your benchmark from the execution of
experiments. Create and save instances in a separate process to minimize errors.
The goal is to make your evaluation as error-proof as possible, avoiding the
frustration and wasted effort of basing decisions on flawed data. Be
particularly cautious with pseudo-random number generators; while theoretically
deterministic, their use can inadvertently lead to irreproducible results.
Sharing benchmarks is also more straightforward when you can distribute the
instances themselves, rather than the code used to generate them.

### Efficiently Managing Your Benchmarks

Managing benchmark data can become complex, especially with multiple experiments
and research questions. Here are some strategies to keep things organized:

- **Folder Structure**: Maintain a clear folder structure for your experiments,
  with a top-level `evaluations` folder and descriptive subfolders for each
  experiment. For our experiment we have the following structure:
  ```
  evaluations
  ├── tsp
  │   ├── 2023-11-18_random_euclidean
  │   │   ├── PRIVATE_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... all data for debugging
  │   │   ├── PUBLIC_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... selected data to share
  │   │   ├── README.md: Provide a short description of the experiment
  │   │   ├── 00_generate_instances.py
  │   │   ├── 01_run_experiments.py
  │   │   ├── ....
  │   ├── 2023-11-18_tsplib
  │   │   ├── PRIVATE_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... all data for debugging
  │   │   ├── PUBLIC_DATA
  │   │   │   ├── ... selected data to share
  │   │   ├── README.md: Provide a short description of the experiment
  │   │   ├── 01_run_experiments.py
  │   │   ├── ....
  ```
- **Redundancy and Documentation**: While some redundancy is acceptable,
  comprehensive documentation of each experiment is crucial for future
  reference.
- **Simplified Results**: Keep a streamlined version of your results for easy
  access, especially for plotting and sharing.
- **Data Storage**: Save all your data, even if it seems insignificant at the
  time. This ensures you have a comprehensive dataset for later analysis or
  unexpected inquiries. Because this can become a lot of data, it is advisable
  to have two folders: One with all data and one with a selection of data that
  you want to share.
- **Experiment Flexibility**: Design experiments to be interruptible and
  extendable, allowing for easy resumption or modification. This is especially
  important for exploratory studies, where you may need to make frequent
  adjustments. However, if your workhorse study takes a long time to run, you do
  not want to repeat it from scratch if you want to add a further solver.
- **Utilizing Technology**: Employ tools like slurm for efficient distribution
  of experiments across computing clusters, saving time and resources. The
  faster you have your results, the faster you can act on them.

Due to a lack of tools that exactly fitted my needs I developed
[AlgBench](https://github.com/d-krupke/AlgBench) to manage the results, and
[Slurminade](https://github.com/d-krupke/slurminade) to easily distribute the
experiments on a cluster via a simple decorator. However, there may be better
tools out there, now, especially from the Machine Learning community. Drop me a
quick mail if you have found some tools you are happy with, and I will take a
look myself.

### Analyzing the results

Let us now come to the actual analysis of the results. We will focus on the
following questions:

- Up to which size can we solve TSP instances with the different solvers?
- Which solver is the fastest?
- How does the performance change if we increase the optimality tolerance?

**Our Benchmarks:** We executed the four solvers with a time limit of 90s and
the optimality tolerances [0.1%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%] on a random benchmark set and
a TSPLIB benchmark set. The random benchmark set consists of 10 instances for
each number of nodes
`[25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500]`. The weights were
chosen based on randomly embedding the nodes into a 2D plane and using the
Euclidean distances. The TSPLIB benchmark consists of all Euclidean instances
with less than 500 nodes. It is critical to have a time limit, as otherwise, the
benchmarks would take forever. You can find all find the whole experiment
[here](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/).

Let us first look at the results of the random benchmark, as they are easier to
interpret. We will then compare them to the TSPLIB benchmark.

#### Random Instances

A common, yet simplistic method to assess a model's performance involves
plotting its runtime against the size of the instances it processes. However,
this approach can often lead to inaccurate interpretations, particularly because
time-limited cutoffs can disproportionately affect the results. Instead of the
expected exponential curves, you will get skewed sigmoidal curves. Consequently,
such plots might not provide a clear understanding of the instance sizes your
model is capable of handling efficiently.

|                                                                             ![Runtime](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/runtime.png)                                                                              |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| The runtimes are sigmoidal instead of exponential because the time limit skews the results. The runtime can frequently exceed the time limit, because of expensive model building, etc. Thus, a pure runtime plot says surprisingly little (or is misleading) and can usually be discarded. |

Instead of just cutting off the runtime, a common metric is PAR10, which sets
the runtime to 10 times the time limit if the solver does not finish within the
time limit, and will actually penalize timeouts. However, it still does not
solve the problem that we actually do not know the true runtime such that these
plots will always lie.

To gain a more accurate insight into the capacities of your model, consider
plotting the proportion of instances of a certain size that your model
successfully solves. This method requires a well-structured benchmark to yield
meaningful statistics for each data point. Without this structure, the resulting
curve may appear erratic, making it challenging to draw dependable conclusions.

| ![Solved over size](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size.png) |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                            For each x-value: What are the chances (y-values) that a model of this size (x) can be solved?                            |

Furthermore, if the pursuit is not limited to optimal solutions but extends to
encompass solutions of acceptable quality, the analysis can be expanded. One can
plot the number of instances that the model solves within a defined optimality
tolerance, as demonstrated in the subsequent figure:

| ![Solved over size with optimality tolerance](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size_opt_tol.png) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                              For each x-value: What are the chances (y-values) that a model of this size (x) can be solved to what quality (line style)?                               |

For a comparative analysis across various models against an arbitrary benchmark,
cactus plots emerge as a potent tool. These plots illustrate the number of
instances solved over time, providing a clear depiction of a model's efficiency.
For example, a coordinate of $x=10, y=20$ on such a plot signifies that 20
instances were solved within a span of 10 seconds each. It is important to note,
however, that these plots do not facilitate predictions for any specific
instance unless the benchmark set is thoroughly familiar. They do allow for an
estimation of which model is quicker for simpler instances and which can handle
more challenging instances within a reasonable timeframe. The question of what
exactly is a simple or challenging instance, however, is better answered by the
previous plots.

Cactus plots are notably prevalent in the evaluation of SAT-solvers, where
instance size is a poor indicator of difficulty. A more detailed discussion on
this subject can be found in the referenced academic paper:
[Benchmarking Solvers, SAT-style by Brain, Davenport, and Griggio](http://www.sc-square.org/CSA/workshop2-papers/RP3-FinalVersion.pdf)

| ![Cactus Plot 1](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot.png) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                  For each x-value: How many (y) of the benchmark instances could have been solved with this time limit (x)?                  |

Additionally, the analysis can be refined to account for different quality
tolerances. This requires either multiple experimental runs or tracking the
progression of the lower and upper bounds within the solver. In the context of
CP-SAT, for instance, this tracking can be implemented via the Solution
Callback, although its activation is may depend on updates to the objective
rather than the bounds.

| ![Cactus Plot 1](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_random_euclidean/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot_opt_tol.png) |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|    For each x-value: How many (y) of the benchmark instances could have been solved to a specific quality (line style) with this time limit (x)?     |

Instead of plotting the number of solved instances, one can also plot the number
of unsolved instances over time. This can be easier to read and additionally
indicates the number of instances in the benchmark. However, I personally do not
have a preference for one or the other, and would recommend using the one that
is more intuitive to read for you.

#### TSPLIB

Our second benchmark for the Traveling Salesman Problem leverages the TSPLIB, a
set of instances based on real-world data. This will introduce two challenges:

1. The difficulty in aggregating benchmark data due to its limited size and
   heterogeneous nature.
2. Notable disparities in results, arising from the differing characteristics of
   random and real-world instances.

The irregularity in instance sizes makes traditional plotting methods, like
plotting the number of solved instances over time, less effective. While data
smoothing methods, such as rolling averages, are available, they too have their
limitations.

| ![Variation in Data](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_tsplib/PUBLIC_DATA/solved_over_size.png) |
| :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|       Such a plot may prove inefficient when dealing with high variability, particularly when some data points are underrepresented.        |

In contrast, the cactus plot still provides a clear and comprehensive
perspective of various model performances. An interesting observation we can
clearly see in it, is the diminished capability of the "Iterative Dantzig" model
in solving instances, and a closer performance alignment between the
`add_circuit` and Gurobi models.

| ![Effective Cactus Plot](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/evaluations/tsp/2023-11-18_tsplib/PUBLIC_DATA/cactus_plot_opt_tol.png) |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                Cactus plots maintain clarity and relevance, and show a performance differences between TSPLib and random instances.                |

However, since cactus plots do not offer insights into individual instances, it
is beneficial to complement them with a detailed table of results for the
specific model you are focusing on. This approach ensures a more nuanced
understanding of model performance across varied instances. The following table
provides the results for the `add_circuit`-model.

A last option is to split the y-axis into the part where the solving time is
still within the time limit, and the part where it is not and the optimality gap
becomes relevant. Such a plot has some benefits but can also be difficult to
scale or aggregate.

| This plot splits the y-axis into a part where the instances can still be solved within the time limit, such that the time can be shown, and the part where the time limit is exceeded, such that the optimality gap can be shown. This example was generated by my student assistant Rouven Kniep, and he is working on creating an easy-to-use script for such plots. |

This should highlight that often you need a combination of different benchmarks
and plots to get a good understanding of the performance of your model.

### Comparing Production with Development Versions on Multiple Metrics

In applied benchmarking, a common task is evaluating whether the latest version
of your algorithm is actually better than the previous one, particularly when
you do not have a single, clear metric for comparison. Once your implementation
reaches a certain level of maturity, improving all aspects simultaneously
becomes challenging, and trade-offs are often necessary. Additionally, if
business requirements change, new constraints might be introduced that could
negatively impact some metrics, which managers may not fully understand. In such
cases, it is useful to directly compare how various metrics change between the
two versions.

One effective method for this comparison is using scatter plots, where the
x-axis represents the metric values from the old version, and the y-axis
represents the values from the new version. Points on the diagonal indicate
instances where nothing has changed, points above the diagonal show where the
metric increased, and points below the diagonal indicate a decrease. This visual
representation gives you a clear overview of where improvements have been made
and where performance has declined, highlighting the trade-offs involved. This
information can help you determine whether you are moving in the right
direction.

Scatter plots are particularly valuable when you cannot rely on a single metric
to compare the two versions but need to understand the overall impact of the
changes and the trade-offs made. The following figure shows an example from an
imaginary delivery optimization problem, where the new algorithm is able to
reduce the longest delivery tours but slightly degrades on the average tours of
a delivery schedule. Based on this data, you can then decide with the manager if
the trade-off is acceptable.

| These scatter plots illustrate how metrics change between two versions of an algorithm and where trade-offs are necessary. They also help identify outliers—for example, if you have generally improved but see a significant degradation for certain individual instances. However, this type of plot is most effective for comparing two versions and can become less readable if the differences between the versions are too substantial. Consider these as exploratory tools that reveal general trends. |

### Conclusion

Benchmarking solvers for NP-hard problems is not as straightforward as it might
seem at first. There are many pitfalls and often there is no perfect solution.
On the example of the TSP, we have seen how we can still get some useful results
and nice plots on which we can base our decisions.

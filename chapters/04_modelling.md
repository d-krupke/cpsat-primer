<!-- STOP_SKIP_FOR_README -->

In this chapter, we dive into the basic modeling capabilities of CP-SAT. CP-SAT
provides an extensive set of constraints, closer to high-level modeling
languages like MiniZinc than to traditional Mixed Integer Programming (MIP). For
example, it offers constraints like `all_different` and
`add_multiplication_equality`. These advanced features reduce the need for
modeling complex logic strictly through linear constraints, though they also
increase the interface's complexity. However, not all constraints are equally
efficient; linear and boolean constraints are generally most efficient, whereas
constraints like `add_multiplication_equality` can be significantly more
resource-intensive.

This primer has been expanded to cover all constraints across two chapters,
complete with various examples to illustrate the contexts in which they can be
used. However, mastering modeling involves much more than just an understanding
of constraints. It requires a deep appreciation of the principles and techniques
that make models effective and applicable to real-world problems.

For a more detailed exploration of modeling, consider "Model Building in
Mathematical Programming" by H. Paul Williams, which offers extensive insight
into the subject, including practical applications. While this book is not
specific to CP-SAT, the foundational techniques and concepts are broadly
applicable. Additionally, for those new to this area or transitioning from MIP
solutions, studying Gurobi's modeling approach through this
[video course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHiHZENG6W8CezJLx_cw9mNqpmviq3lO9)
might prove helpful. While many principles overlap, some strategies unique to
CP-SAT can better address cases where traditional MIP-solvers struggle.

### Variables

There are two important types of variables in CP-SAT: Booleans and Integers
(which are actually converted to Booleans, but more on this later). There are
also, e.g.,
[interval variables](https://developers.google.com/optimization/reference/python/sat/python/cp_model#intervalvar),
but they are actually rather a combination of integral variables and discussed
[later](#04-modelling-intervals). For the integer variables, you have to specify
a lower and an upper bound.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Integer variable z with bounds -100 <= z <= 100
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")  # new syntax
z_ = model.NewIntVar(-100, 100, "z_")  # old syntax

# Boolean variable b
b = model.new_bool_var("b")  # new syntax
b_ = model.NewBoolVar("b_")  # old syntax

# Implicitly available negation of b:
not_b = ~b  # will be 1 if b is 0 and 0 if b is 1
not_b_ = b.Not()  # old syntax
```

Additionally, you can use `model.new_int_var_series` and
`model.new_bool_var_series` to create multiple variables at once from a pandas
Index. This is especially useful if your data is given in a pandas DataFrame.
However, there is no performance benefit in using this method, it is just more
convenient.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Create an Index from 0 to 9
index = pd.Index(range(10), name="index")

# Create a pandas Series with 10 integer variables matching the index
xs = model.new_int_var_series("x", index, 0, 100)

# List of boolean variables
df = pd.DataFrame(
    data={"weight": [1 for _ in range(10)], "value": [3 for _ in range(10)]},
    index=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J"],
)
bs = model.new_bool_var_series("b", df.index)  # noqa: F841

# Using the dot product on the pandas DataFrame is actually a pretty
# convenient way to create common linear expressions.
model.add(bs @ df["weight"] <= 100)
model.maximize(bs @ df["value"])
```

Additionally, there is the `new_constant`-method, which allows you to create a
variable that is constant. This allows you to safely replace variables by
constants. This is primarily useful for boolean variables, as constant integer
variables can in most cases be simply replaced by plain integers.

There are no continuous/floating point variables (or even constants) in CP-SAT:
If you need floating point numbers, you have to approximate them with integers
by some resolution. For example, you could simply multiply all values by 100 for
a step size of 0.01. A value of 2.35 would then be represented by 235. This
_could_ probably be implemented in CP-SAT directly, but doing it explicitly is
not difficult, and it has numerical implications that you should be aware of.

The absence of continuous variables may appear as a substantial limitation,
especially for those with a background in linear optimization where continuous
variables are typically regarded as the simpler component. However, if your
problem includes only a few continuous variables that must be approximated using
large integers and involves complex constraints such as absolute values, while
the majority of the problem is dominated by logical constraints, CP-SAT can
often outperform mixed-integer programming solvers. It is only when a problem
contains a substantial number of continuous variables and benefits significantly
from strong linear relaxation that mixed-integer programming solvers will have a
distinct advantage, despite CP-SAT having a propagator based on the dual simplex
method.

I analyzed the impact of resolution (i.e., the factor by which floating point
numbers are multiplied) on the runtime of CP-SAT, finding that the effect varied
depending on the problem. For one problem, the runtime increased only
logarithmically with the resolution, allowing the use of a very high resolution
of 100,000x without significant issues. In contrast, for another problem, the
runtime increased roughly linearly with the resolution, making high resolutions
impractical. The runtime for different factors in this case was: 1x: 0.02s, 10x:
0.7s, 100x: 7.6s, 1000x: 75s, and 10,000x: over 15 minutes, even though the
solution remained the same, merely scaled. Therefore, while high resolutions may
be feasible for some problems using CP-SAT, it is essential to verify their
influence on runtime, as the impact can be considerable.

In my experience, boolean variables are crucial in many combinatorial
optimization problems. For instance, the famous Traveling Salesman Problem
consists solely of boolean variables. Therefore, implementing a solver that
specializes in boolean variables using a SAT-solver as a foundation, such as
CP-SAT, is a sensible approach. CP-SAT leverages the strengths of SAT-solving
techniques, which are highly effective for problems dominated by boolean
variables.

You may wonder why it is necessary to explicitly name the variables in CP-SAT.
While there does not appear to be a technical reason for this requirement,
naming the variables can be extremely helpful for debugging purposes.
Understanding the naming scheme of the variables allows you to more easily
interpret the internal representation of the model, facilitating the
identification and resolution of issues. To be fair, there have only been a few
times when I actually needed to take a closer at the internal representation,
and in most of the cases I would have preferred not to have to name the
variables.

<a name="04-modelling-domain-variables"></a>

#### Custom Domain Variables

When dealing with integer variables that you know will only need to take certain
values, or when you wish to limit their possible values, custom domain variables
can become interesting. Unlike regular integer variables, which must have a
domain between a given range of values (e.g., $\[ 1, 100 \]$), domain variables
can specify a custom set of values as domain (e.g., $\\{1, 3, 5 \\}$). This
approach can enhance efficiency when the domain - the range of sensible values -
is small. However, it may not be the best choice for larger domains.

CP-SAT works by converting all integer variables into boolean variables
(warning: simplification). For each potential value, it creates two boolean
variables: one indicating whether the integer variable is equal to this value,
and another indicating whether it is less than or equal to it. This is called an
_order encoding_. At first glance, this might suggest that using domain
variables is always preferable, as it appears to reduce the number of boolean
variables needed.

However, CP-SAT employs a lazy creation strategy for these boolean variables.
This means it only generates them as needed, based on the solver's
decision-making process. Therefore, an integer variable with a wide range - say,
from 0 to 100 - will not immediately result in 200 boolean variables. It might
lead to the creation of only a few, depending on the solver's requirements.

Limiting the domain of a variable can have drawbacks. Firstly, defining a domain
explicitly can be computationally costly and increase the model size drastically
as it now need to contain not just a lower and upper bound for a variable but an
explicit list of numbers (model size is often a limiting factor). Secondly, by
narrowing down the solution space, you might inadvertently make it more
challenging for the solver to find a viable solution. First, try to let CP-SAT
handle the domain of your variables itself and only intervene if you have a good
reason to do so.

If you choose to utilize domain variables for their benefits in specific
scenarios, here is how to define them:

```python
from ortools.sat.python import cp_model

model = cp_model.CpModel()

# Define a domain with selected values
domain = cp_model.Domain.from_values([2, 5, 8, 10, 20, 50, 90])

# Can also be done via intervals
domain_2 = cp_model.Domain.from_intervals([[8, 12], [14, 20]])

# There are also some operations available
domain_3 = domain.union_with(domain_2)

# Create a domain variable within this defined domain
x = model.new_int_var_from_domain(domain, "x")
```

This example illustrates the process of creating a domain variable `x` that can
only take on the values specified in `domain`. This method is particularly
useful when you are working with variables that only have a meaningful range of
possible values within your problem's context.

### Objectives

Not every problem necessitates an objective; sometimes, finding a feasible
solution is sufficient. CP-SAT excels at finding feasible solutions, a task at
which mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers often do not perform as well.
However, CP-SAT is also capable of effective optimization, which is an area
where older constraint programming solvers may lag, based on my experience.

CP-SAT allows for the minimization or maximization of a linear expression. You
can model more complex expressions by using auxiliary variables and additional
constraints. To specify an objective function, you can use the `model.minimize`
or `model.maximize` commands with a linear expression. This flexibility makes
CP-SAT a robust tool for a variety of optimization tasks.

```python
# Basic model with variables and constraints
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
model.add(x + 10 * y <= 100)

# Minimize 30x + 50y
model.maximize(30 * x + 50 * y)
```

Let us look on how to model more complicated expressions, using boolean
variables and generators.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x_vars = [model.new_bool_var(f"x{i}") for i in range(10)]
model.minimize(sum(i * x_vars[i] if i % 2 == 0 else i * ~x_vars[i] for i in range(10)))
```

This objective evaluates to

```math
\min \sum_{i=0}^{9} i\cdot x_i \text{ if } i \text{ is even else } i\cdot \neg x_i
```

To implement a
[lexicographic optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_optimization),
you can do multiple rounds and always fix the previous objective as constraint.

```python
# some basic model
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")
model.add(x + 10 * y - 2 * z <= 100)

# Define the objectives
first_objective = 30 * x + 50 * y
second_objective = 10 * x + 20 * y + 30 * z

# Optimize for the first objective
model.maximize(first_objective)
solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
solver.solve(model)

# Fix the first objective and optimize for the second
model.add(first_objective == int(solver.objective_value))  # fix previous objective
model.minimize(second_objective)  # optimize for second objective
solver.solve(model)
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You can find a more efficient implementation of lexicographic optimization in
> the _Coding Patterns_ chapter.

To handle non-linear objectives in CP-SAT, you can employ auxiliary variables
and constraints. For instance, to incorporate the absolute value of a variable
into your objective, you first create a new variable representing this absolute
value. Shortly, you will learn more about setting up these types of constraints.
Below is a Python example demonstrating how to model and minimize the absolute
value of a variable `x`:

```python
# Assuming x is already defined in your model
abs_x = model.new_int_var(
    0, 100, "|x|"
)  # Create a variable to represent the absolute value of x
model.add_abs_equality(target=abs_x, expr=x)  # Define abs_x as the absolute value of x
model.minimize(abs_x)  # Set the objective to minimize abs_x
```

The constraints available to define your feasible solution space will be
discussed in the following section.

<a name="04-modelling-linear-constraints"></a>

### Linear Constraints

These are the classical constraints also used in linear optimization. Remember
that you are still not allowed to use floating point numbers within it. Same as
for linear optimization: You are not allowed to multiply a variable with
anything else than a constant and also not to apply any further mathematical
operations.

```python
model.add(10 * x + 15 * y <= 10)
model.add(x + z == 2 * y)

# This one actually is not linear but still works.
model.add(x + y != z)

# Because we are working on integers, the true smaller or greater constraints
# are trivial to implement as x < z is equivalent to x <= z-1
model.add(x < y + z)
model.add(y > 300 - 4 * z)
```

Note that `!=` can be slower than the other (`<=`, `>=`, `==`) constraints,
because it is not a linear constraint. If you have a set of mutually `!=`
variables, it is better to use `all_different` (see below) than to use the
explicit `!=` constraints.

Let us look at the following example with two linear equality constraints:

```math
x - y = 0
```

```math
4-y = 2y
```

```math
x, y \geq 0
```

You can verify that $x=4/3$ and $y=4/3$ is a feasible solution. However, coding
this in CP-SAT results in an infeasible solution:

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")

model.add(x - y == 0)
model.add(4 - x == 2 * y)

solver = cp_model.CpSolver()
status = solver.solve(model)
assert status == cp_model.INFEASIBLE
```

Even using scaling techniques, such as multiplying integer variables by
1,000,000 to increase the resolution, would not render the model feasible. While
common linear programming solvers would handle this model without issue, CP-SAT
struggles unless modifications are made to eliminate fractions, such as
multiplying all terms by 3. However, this requires manual intervention, which
undermines the idea of using a solver. These limitations are important to
consider, although such scenarios are rare in practical applications.

> weights = [i for i in range(5)]
> model.add(cp_model.LinearExpr.sum(xs) >= 1)
> model.minimize(cp_model.LinearExpr.weighted_sum(xs, weights))
> ```

If you have a lower and an upper bound for a linear expression, you can also use
the `add_linear_constraint`-method, which allows you to specify both bounds in
one go.

```python
model.add_linear_constraint(linear_expr=10 * x + 15 * y, lb=-100, ub=10)
```

The similar sounding `AddLinearExpressionInDomain` is discussed later.

<a name="04-modelling-logic-constraints"></a>

### Logical Constraints (Propositional Logic)

Propositional logic allows us to describe relationships between true or false
statements using logical operators. Consider a simple scenario where we define
three Boolean variables:

```python
b1 = model.new_bool_var("b1")
b2 = model.new_bool_var("b2")
b3 = model.new_bool_var("b3")
```

These variables, `b1`, `b2`, and `b3`, represent distinct propositions whose
truth values are to be determined by the model.

You can obtain the negation of a Boolean variable by using `~` or the
`.Not()`-method. The resulting variable can be used just like the original
variable:

```python
not_b1 = ~b1  # Negation of b1
not_b2 = b2.Not()  # Alternative notation for negation
```

Note that you can use more than three variables in all of the following
examples, except for `add_implication` which is only defined for two variables.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Boolean variables are essentially special integer variables restricted to the
> domain of 0 and 1. Therefore, you can incorporate them into linear constraints
> as well. However, it is important to note that integer variables, unlike
> Boolean variables, cannot be used in Boolean constraints. This is a
> distinction from some programming languages, like Python, where integers can
> sometimes substitute for Booleans.

#### Adding Logical OR Constraints

The logical OR operation ensures that at least one of the specified conditions
holds true. To model this, you can use:

```python
model.add_bool_or(b1, b2, b3)  # b1 or b2 or b3 must be true
model.add_at_least_one([b1, b2, b3])  # Alternative notation
model.add(b1 + b2 + b3 >= 1)  # Alternative linear notation using '+' for OR
```

Both lines ensure that at least one of `b1`, `b2`, or `b3` is true.

#### Adding Logical AND Constraints

The logical AND operation specifies that all conditions must be true
simultaneously. To model conditions where `b1` is true and both `b2` and `b3`
are false, you can use:

```python
model.add_bool_and(b1, b2.Not(), b3.Not())  # b1 and not b2 and not b3 must all be true
model.add_bool_and(b1, ~b2, ~b3)  # Alternative notation using '~' for negation
```

The `add_bool_and` method is most effective when used with the `only_enforce_if`
method (discussed in
[Conditional Constraints (Reification)](#04-modelling-conditional-constraints)).
For cases not utilizing `only_enforce_if` a simple AND-clause such as
$\left( b_1 \land \neg b_2 \land \neg b_3 \right)$ becomes redundant by simply
substituting $b_1$ with `1` and $b_2, b_3$ with `0`. In straightforward
scenarios, consider substituting these variables with their constant values to
reduce unnecessary complexity, especially in larger models where size and
manageability are concerns. In smaller or simpler models, CP-SAT efficiently
handles these redundancies, allowing you to focus on maintaining clarity and
readability in your model.

#### Adding Logical XOR Constraints

The logical XOR (exclusive OR) operation ensures that an odd number of operands
are true. It is crucial to understand this definition, as it has specific
implications when applied to more than two variables:

- For two variables, such as `b1 XOR b2`, the operation returns true if exactly
  one of these variables is true, which aligns with the "exactly one" constraint
  for this specific case.
- For three or more variables, such as in the expression `b1 XOR b2 XOR b3`, the
  operation returns true if an odd number of these variables are true. This
  includes scenarios where one or three variables are true, assuming the total
  number of variables involved is three.

This characteristic of XOR can be somewhat complex but is crucial for modeling
scenarios where the number of true conditions needs to be odd:

```python
model.add_bool_xor(b1, b2)  # Returns true if exactly one of b1 or b2 is true
model.add_bool_xor(
    b1, b2, b3
)  # Returns true if an odd number of b1, b2, b3 are true (i.e., one or three)
```

#### Specifying Unique Conditions

To enforce that exactly one or at most one of the variables is true, use:

```python
model.add_exactly_one([b1, b2, b3])  # Exactly one of the variables must be true
model.add_at_most_one([b1, b2, b3])  # No more than one of the variables should be true
```

These constraints are useful for scenarios where exclusive choices must be
modeled.

You could alternatively also use `add`.

```python
model.add(b1 + b2 + b3 == 1)  # Exactly one of the variables must be true
model.add(b1 + b2 + b3 <= 1)  # No more than one of the variables should be true
```

#### Modeling Implications

Logical implication, denoted as `->`, indicates that if the first condition is
true, the second must also be true. This can be modeled as:

```python
model.add_implication(b1, b2)  # If b1 is true, then b2 must also be true
```

You could also use `add`.

```python
model.add(b2 >= b1)  # If b1 is true, then b2 must also be true
```

<a name="04-modelling-conditional-constraints"></a>

### Conditional Constraints (Reification)

In practical applications, scenarios often arise where conditions dictate the
enforcement of certain constraints. For instance, "if this condition is true,
then a specific constraint should apply," or "if a constraint is violated, a
penalty variable is set to true, triggering another constraint." Additionally,
real-world constraints can sometimes be bypassed with financial or other types
of concessions, such as renting a more expensive truck to exceed a load limit,
or allowing a worker to take a day off after a double shift.

> In constraint programming, **reification** involves associating a Boolean
> variable with a constraint to capture its truth value, thereby turning the

To effectively manage these conditional scenarios, CP-SAT offers the
`only_enforce_if`-method for linear and some Boolean constraints, which
activates a constraint only if a specified condition is met. This method is not
only typically more efficient than traditional methods like the
[Big-M method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_M_method) but also simplifies
the model by eliminating the need to determine an appropriate Big-M value.

```python
# A value representing the load that needs to be transported
load_value = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "load_value")

# ... some logic to determine the load value ...

# A variable to decide which truck to rent
truck_a = model.new_bool_var("truck_a")
truck_b = model.new_bool_var("truck_b")
truck_c = model.new_bool_var("truck_c")

# Only rent one truck
model.add_at_most_one([truck_a, truck_b, truck_c])

# Depending on which truck is rented, the load value is limited
model.add(load_value <= 50).only_enforce_if(truck_a)
model.add(load_value <= 80).only_enforce_if(truck_b)
model.add(load_value <= 100).only_enforce_if(truck_c)

# Some additional logic
driver_has_big_truck_license = model.new_bool_var("driver_has_big_truck_license")
driver_has_special_license = model.new_bool_var("driver_has_special_license")
# Only drivers with a big truck license or a special license can rent truck c
model.add_bool_or(
    driver_has_big_truck_license, driver_has_special_license
).only_enforce_if(truck_c)

# Minimize the rent cost
model.minimize(30 * truck_a + 40 * truck_b + 80 * truck_c)
```

You can also use negations in the `only_enforce_if` method.

```python
model.add(x + y == 10).only_enforce_if(~b1)
```

You can also pass a list of Boolean variables to `only_enforce_if`, in which
case the constraint is only enforced if all of the variables in the list are
true.

```python
model.add(x + y == 10).only_enforce_if([b1, ~b2])  # only enforce if b1 AND NOT b2
```

### Absolute Values and Maximum/Minimum Functions with Integer Variables

When working with integer variables in CP-SAT, operations such as computing
absolute values, maximum, and minimum values cannot be directly expressed using
basic Python operations like `abs`, `max`, or `min`. Instead, these operations
must be handled through the use of auxiliary variables and specialized
constraints that map these variables to the desired values. The auxiliary
variables can then be used in other constraints, representing the desired
subexpression.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")

# Create an auxiliary variable for the absolute value of x+z
abs_xz = model.new_int_var(0, 200, "|x+z|")
model.add_abs_equality(target=abs_xz, expr=x + z)

# Create variables to capture the maximum and minimum of x, (y-1), and z
max_xyz = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "max(x, y, z-1)")
model.add_max_equality(target=max_xyz, exprs=[x, y - 1, z])

min_xyz = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "min(x, y, z)")
model.add_min_equality(target=min_xyz, exprs=[x, y - 1, z])
```

While some practitioners report that these methods are more efficient than those
available in classical Mixed Integer Programming solvers, such findings are
predominantly based on empirical evidence and specific use-case scenarios. It is
also worth noting that, surprisingly often, these constraints can be substituted
with more efficient linear constraints. Here is an example for achieving maximum
equality in a more efficient way:

```python
x = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "z")

# Ensure that max_xyz is at least the maximum of x, y, and z
max_xyz = model.new_int_var(0, 100, "max_xyz")
model.add(max_xyz >= x)
model.add(max_xyz >= y)
model.add(max_xyz >= z)

# Minimizing max_xyz to ensure it accurately reflects the maximum value
model.minimize(max_xyz)
```

This approach takes advantage of the solver's minimization function to tighten
the bound, accurately reflecting the maximum of `x`, `y`, and `z`. By utilizing
linear constraints, this method can often achieve faster solving times compared
to using the `add_max_equality` constraint. Similar techniques also exist for
managing absolute and minimum values, as well as for complex scenarios where
direct enforcement of equality through the objective function is not feasible.

### Multiplication, Division, and Modulo

In practical problems, you may need to perform more complex arithmetic
operations than simple additions. Consider the scenario where the rental cost
for a set of trucks is calculated as the product of the number of trucks, the
number of days, and the daily rental rate. Here, the first two factors are
variables, leading to a quadratic expression. Attempting to multiply two
variables directly in CP-SAT will result in an error because the `add` method
only accepts linear expressions, which are sums of variables and constants.
However, CP-SAT supports multiplication, division, and modulo operations.
Similar to using `abs`, `max`, and `min`, you must create an auxiliary variable
to represent the result of the operation.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")

xyz = model.new_int_var(-(100**3), 100**3, "x*y*z")
model.add_multiplication_equality(xyz, [x, y, z])  # xyz = x*y*z

model.add_modulo_equality(x, y, 3)  # x = y % 3
model.add_division_equality(x, y, z)  # x = y // z
```

When using these operations, you often transition from linear to non-linear
optimization, which is generally more challenging to solve. In cases of
division, it is essential to remember that operations are on integers;
therefore, `5 // 2` results in `2`, not `2.5`.

Many problems initially involve non-linear expressions that can often be
reformulated or approximated using linear expressions. This transformation can
enhance the tractability and speed of solving the problem. Although modeling
your problem as closely as possible to the real-world scenario is crucial, it is
equally important to balance accuracy with tractability. A highly accurate model
is futile if the solver cannot optimize it efficiently. It might be beneficial
to employ multiple phases in your optimization process, starting with a simpler,
less accurate model and gradually refining it.

Some non-linear expressions can still be managed efficiently if they are convex.
For instance, second-order cone constraints can be solved in polynomial time
using interior point methods. Gurobi, for example, supports these constraints
natively. CP-SAT includes an LP-propagator but relies on the Dual Simplex
algorithm, which is not suitable for these constraints and must depend on
simpler methods. Similarly, most open-source MIP solvers may struggle with these
constraints.

It is challenging to determine if CP-SAT can handle non-linear expressions
efficiently or which solver would be best suited for your problem. Non-linear
expressions are invariably complex, and avoiding them when possible is
advisable.

Here is one of my students' favorite examples of a non-linear expression that
can be avoided. Once introduced to mathematical notation like
$\sum_{e \in E} cost(e)\cdot x_e$, if a term depends on the combination of two
binary variables, they might initially opt for a quadratic expression such as
$\sum_{e,e'\in E} concost(e, e')\cdot x_e\cdot x_{e'}$. However, such cases can
often be modeled linearly using an auxiliary variable, avoiding the complexities
of non-linear modeling.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()

b1 = model.new_bool_var("b1")
b2 = model.new_bool_var("b2")

b1b2 = model.new_bool_var("b1b2")
model.add_implication(~b1, ~b1b2)
model.add_implication(~b2, ~b1b2)
model.add_bool_or(~b1, ~b2, b1b2)  # optional, for a penalty term to be minimized.
```

There are numerous further instances where non-linear expressions can be
simplified by using auxiliary variables or by shifting the non-linear components
into constants. However, exploring these techniques is most beneficial when you
encounter specific challenges related to non-linear expressions in your models.

We will revisit further discussions on non-linear expressions and their
conversion to piecewise linear approximations in a subsequent section. This will
provide a foundational understanding necessary for addressing more complex
modeling scenarios effectively.

### All Different

In various assignment and scheduling problems, ensuring that all variables hold
distinct values is crucial. For example, in frequency assignment, no two
transmitters within the same area should operate on the same frequency, or in
scheduling, no two tasks should occupy the same time slot. Typically, this
requirement could be modeled with a quadratic number of inequality (`!=`)
constraints. However, a more elegant solution involves using the
`add_all_different` constraint, which directly enforces that all variables in a
list take unique values. This constraint is particularly useful in solving
puzzles like Sudoku or the
[N-queens problem](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/queens).

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")

# Adding an all-different constraint
model.add_all_different([x, y, z])

# Advanced usage with transformations
vars = [model.new_int_var(0, 10, f"v_{i}") for i in range(10)]
model.add_all_different([x + i for i, x in enumerate(vars)])
```

Using `add_all_different` not only simplifies the modeling but also utilizes a
dedicated domain-based propagator in CP-SAT, enhancing efficiency beyond what is
achievable with multiple `!=` constraints. However, if your model mixes `!=`
constraints with `add_all_different`, be cautious, as CP-SAT disables automatic
inference of `add_all_different` from groups of `!=` constraints, which can lead
to performance penalties.

For a practical demonstration, refer to the
[graph coloring problem example](https://github.com/d-krupke/cpsat-primer/blob/main/examples/add_all_different.ipynb)
in our repository. Here, using `!=` constraints solved the problem in seconds,
whereas `add_all_different` took significantly longer, illustrating the
importance of choosing the right method based on the problem scale and
complexity.

Alternatively, modeling with Boolean variables and constraints like
`add_at_most_one` or pairwise negations (`add_boolean_or(~b1, ~b2)`) can also be
effective. This approach benefits from CP-SAT's efficient handling of Boolean
logic and allows for easy integration of additional constraints or objectives,
such as licensing costs associated with certain frequencies. Although CP-SAT
does something similar internally, it creates these constructs lazily and only
as needed, whereas explicit modeling in Python may not be as efficient.

The choice between these methodsâ€”or potentially another strategyâ€”depends on
specific model requirements and familiarity with CP-SAT's behavior. When in
doubt, start with the most intuitive method and refine your approach based on
performance observations.

<a name="04-modelling-table"></a>

### Domains and Combinations

When optimizing scenarios with predefined feasible values or combinations of
variablesâ€”often outlined in a tableâ€”it is advantageous to directly restrict the
domain of an expression or set of variables.

Consider an example where you are optimizing a shift schedule for a team of
employees, and you have a table of feasible combinations for each shift:

| Employee 1 | Employee 2 | Employee 3 | Employee 4 |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1          | 0          | 1          | 0          |
| 0          | 1          | 1          | 0          |
| 1          | 0          | 0          | 1          |
| 0          | 1          | 0          | 1          |

In CP-SAT, this can be modeled efficiently using the `add_allowed_assignments`
method:

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x_employee_1 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_1")
x_employee_2 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_2")
x_employee_3 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_3")
x_employee_4 = model.new_bool_var("x_employee_4")

# Define the allowed assignments
allowed_assignments = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1],
]

model.add_allowed_assignments(
    [x_employee_1, x_employee_2, x_employee_3, x_employee_4], allowed_assignments
)
```

Alternatively, forbidden combinations can be specified using
`add_forbidden_assignments`:

```python
prohibit_assignments = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 0, 1],
]
model.add_forbidden_assignments(
    [x_employee_1, x_employee_2, x_employee_3, x_employee_4], prohibit_assignments
)
```

The utility of the `add_allowed_assignments` method becomes more apparent when
integrated with other constraints within the model, rather than when it spans
all variables. If the table covered all variables, one could theoretically
evaluate each row to identify the best solution without the need for
sophisticated optimization techniques. However, consider this scenario where
constraints are integrated across multiple shifts:

```python
NUM_SHIFTS = 7

model = cp_model.CpModel()
x_employee_1 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_1_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]
x_employee_2 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_2_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]
x_employee_3 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_3_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]
x_employee_4 = [model.new_bool_var(f"x_employee_4_{i}") for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS)]

for i in range(NUM_SHIFTS):
    model.add_allowed_assignments(
        [x_employee_1[i], x_employee_2[i], x_employee_3[i], x_employee_4[i]],
        allowed_assignments,
    )

# ... some further constraints and objectives to connect the days ...
# ... if the days would be independent, you would solve each day separately ...
```

The `add_allowed_assignments` method in CP-SAT enables the direct incorporation
of specific feasible combinations into your optimization model, ensuring that
only certain configurations of variables are considered within the solution
space. This method effectively "hard-codes" these configurations, simplifying
the model by predefining which combinations of variables are permissible, much
like setting rules for employee shifts or resource allocations.

A related method for managing linear expressions instead of direct assignments
is `add_linear_expression_in_domain`. Suppose we know a certain linear
expression, \(10x + 5y\), must equal 20, 50, or 100:

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")

domain = cp_model.Domain.from_values([20, 50, 100])
model.add_linear_expression_in_domain(10 * x + 5 * y, domain)
```

### Element/Array Constraints

Before exploring specialized constraints, let us examine the last of the generic
ones. The element constraint facilitates accessing the value of a variable (or
since ortools 9.12, a linear expression) within an array using another variable
as the index. Accessing a variable in an array with a constant index is
straightforward; however, integrating a variable index into your model adds
complexity. This constraint can also be used to ensure that a variable matches
the value at a specific array position.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
x = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "x")
y = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "y")
z = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "z")
var_array = [x, y, z]

# Create a variable for the index and a variable for the value at that index.
index_var = model.new_int_var(0, len(var_array) - 1, "index")
value_at_index_var = model.new_int_var(-100, 100, "value_at_index")

# Apply the element constraint to link the index and value variables.
model.add_element(expressions=var_array, index=index_var, target=value_at_index_var)
# CAVEAT: Before ortools 9.12, it was `variables=` instead of `expressions=`.
```

Examples of feasible variable assignments:

| `x` | `y` | `z` | `index_var` | `value_at_index` |
| --- | --- | --- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 0           | 3                |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 1           | 4                |
| 3   | 4   | 5   | 2           | 5                |
| 7   | 3   | 4   | 0           | 7                |

The subsequent constraint resembles a stable matching in array form. For two
equally sized arrays of variables $v$ and $w$, each of size $|v|$, it imposes a
bijective relationship: $v[i]=j \Leftrightarrow w[j]=i$ for all
$i,j \in 0,\ldots,|v|-1$. This constraint limits the variables' values to
$0,\ldots, |v|-1$.

```python
model = cp_model.CpModel()
v = [model.new_int_var(0, 5, f"v_{i}") for i in range(6)]
w = [model.new_int_var(0, 5, f"w_{i}") for i in range(6)]

model.add_inverse(v, w)
```

Examples of feasible variable assignments:

| array | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| w     | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |

| array | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v     | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 0   |
| w     | 5   | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

| array | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v     | 1   | 0   | 3   | 5   | 2   | 4   |
| w     | 1   | 0   | 4   | 2   | 5   | 3   |
